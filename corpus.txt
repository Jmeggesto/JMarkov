M&M cookies. cheesecake. wiggles. let's make a yummy cheecakes. wat. SALGEXICON. wait is that David in the video. i thought so. if my parents *thought* I was being "snotty" they'd either instantly shut down and hate me or worse, threaten physical violence. I really regret that I never like, screamed at them . or got to a point where I was willing to call them on their shit. s'okay. i am mildly upset because someone I know was (probably joking) making a thing out of the West Coast/East Coast 'rivalry'. i don't know why but anything like that, any pointless rivalry or hating on something that is pointless to hate on (like those "pineapple on pizza is a sin" memes) make me upset. yeah. Tribe? also, hi. i am puppo. chapbook? And, who's Ellie. nods. i see. do I have any mutual friends with y'all, other than in ##tf? i wish i were more active on Tumblr but I dunno what to do or say or anything. cool. it looks cool. hi. curls. <3. that filter is hard to look at. OMG . i just saw the coolest thing on FB. oh wait i can share it here too . https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2086970389/whisk-wiper-whisking-made-easy. <333333. laughs evilly. i think so. i'm not feeling *super* talkative or engaged. just kinda detached. that's true. still haven't gotten fucking apologized to. no. is it wrong of me to expect an apology over something like that? maybe i'm dwelling on it too much. but I expect people to apologize when they do something like that. i'm worried that me saying "hey, you never apologized" will be received poorly. yeah. yeah... s'okay. i'll explain. i was looking for my keys at 's place. was on the couch and lying down and I asked her "hey can you get up" so I could search there. she said "yeah" and i looked around the area for a bit longer. then I went back up to the couch and said it again, "hey can you get up (so I can look on the couch)", just a reminder because it was sorta time-sensitive that we find the keys, in a neutral tone. she yelled "FINE!!!!" really loudly and stormed off. I said "please don't yell at me" and she said "fuck off". apparently it triggered feelings/fears related to past abuse, like she would be hit/abused/denied food or something. which i can empathize with but that does not excuse or make it okay. at all under any circumstances. i don't currently have headphones. i was borrowing Willa's but she took them back. i will have to buy some soon. can i obtain them in-person? I would like to get them ASAP. okay. people have suggested that my lack of feeling really deep connections and emotionally relating to things is probably due to depression. i feel very analytical and literal and have like I have little use for relying on emotions about things. and it sort of feels insulting, the insinuation that the person I am isn't "me" but is clouded by depression. Like I'd magically have all these Feelings if I wasn't depressed. i envy people who like, watch a book or movie or show and are like "oh wow that was so moving, I cried, i related to it so much and i got so many feels". all I can muster up is "I enjoyed it because X, Y, and Z and give it good marks on cinematography and acting, but found Q and W aspects lacking:. yeah. i mean, I know I'm not. but the idea that me not developing those emotional connections simply because of depression is...idk. “That sounds more like depression eating your feelings than an innate trait”. ^ friend said that after I was talking about lack of spirituality and connection and emotion for things. you can see what/yeah definitely, what? nods. i don't know what to do about it. maybe it's ~all just depression~ and there's some magical me lurking beneath the surface. or whatever. i understand why people write poetry/sing songs about things like being trans, but I don't know if I could ever do it. i wish i had the emotional connection to anything to be able to write. heh, "excites". i just dunno that i have a strong connection to the concept of expressing mysel. *myself. i dunno. i can get excited about Things. re: photography, that's out of a desire to learn a skill I don't know and share an interest with someone I love. and I find programming fascinating and intriguing and curious and cool but i'm not sure how much I feel about it other than "wow so cool". it doesn't hold huge emotional significance to me, i guess? i dunno. it's hard to say when i'm this depressed, if the things I say are even true/accurate. a lot in what way? how so? sometimes. being yelled at really fucking set off our entire night. yeah... curls. i feel so lonely and sad and disconnected and lacking spirituality and lacking deep emotions. yes please. i want that too. i sort of want to do hangouts but don't know if I have the energy. it would be nice to have a decision made for me. ok. i'll probably be going right to sleep, is the tihng. would you like me to curl up with y'all? okay. call me? bork. nunum. let's that be us? yes please. are you okay, ? you're so gorgeous and lovely and amazing. and deserve all good things and love. our wife is gorgeous, isn't she, ? wiggles. ...we want to take care of you and be there for you always. borble. :(. yeah.

Jackie and I are barely different it feels sometimes. how. if we're basically the same person it doesn't even matter. except they'd be an entirely different person and we wouldn't share memories... it sucks. leads you to doubt self. unable to disentangle whose what is whose. what belongs to one. where the line is drawn. especially when you all like the same things...mostly identical interstes/disinterests. i wish i liked something she didn't. it was easier back when we were first distinct but now it's like....the constant overwhelming suicidal-ideation-inducing stress of this fucking nazi country is making it impossible to feel any joy in being ourselves. can you rephrease that last part please. ? i don't understand. ii mean we're not the same obviously, but... what we're upset aobut it... lack of MORE distinction. more individuality. yeah, i know. i was just clarifying what w'ere actually upset about. i dunno. i can't even think of anything we mgiht WANT to do differently, really... i like dressing more femme but we just wear the same thing every day mostly lately bcoz spoons. that mgiht be nice. i wanted to get my own little plushie in addition to francis. that only I would cuddle with, and same for Jackie. oh wow. i never considered the idea of taking photographs and labeling them as who was fronting while photo was taken. love too. drained, super depressed. been constantly fearful/anxious/depressed for weeks now. i don't think sio. it just feels awful. i want to be able to celebrate myself. i feel like i can't because there's so much fear in the way. anxiety. it's like, what's the point. if nazis just torture me and kill me in the ned. what do you mean. let's hope. i'm not optimistic. i hope. sorry I'm restricting us from having fun by doing nothing and being depressed. trying to think of way to feel like me right now. to feel distinct. feel good about me. feel good about ruby. Wonkavator. //images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F41.media.tumblr.com%2F4f668ada5623d45559d6dcca4d3cfb51%2Ftumblr_nkm3so6T4Y1r2vmy7o1_500.jpg&f=1. ? oh . can you call. well fuck. i'm defs not okay though. ok. no. not right now. thank you for your offer. i love you too. , ? love. love. it ok. bad. just bad. just bad bad bad. ok. i actually took my meds today so that's good. i was talking to earlier and idk what happened. if I upset her or did something wrong. or hurt her. i was talking to her about Lizzy (my friend) and she was talking about how she was trying to detach so she didn't spiral that way too. and then talking about how she feels guilty for not killing herself because she feels like she hurts everyone. and i said no, that wasn't true, that it would hurt even more for her to hurt herself. and i was just so numb and felt like i was being a burden so I said "I'll leave you alone now" on IRC and quit. and she said "I'm sorry I hurt you too" and I kind of freaked out a bit because she wasn't hurting me. and I said. “you didn't fucking hurt me ,my friend killed herself and i'm upset, okay? okay??”. and she said "I'll leave you alone now" and i haven't been able to talk to her. i dunno what to do. and i feel like she'll blame me. or something. yeah. i just dunno if I'll be able to get that through to her. sigh. it feels fake. Lizzy being gone feels fake. idk. i think i'm just not going to play these games to see if she's okay. if she's not she can just tell me. i'm not putting the energy into it. i doubt she hates me/will stay upset or whatever. it's just like. part of me thinks "why is it always all about her no matter what?". which feels awful to think. huh? no. it wasn't about anyone. and it's not REALLY like she's like that. it can just be frustrating. curl. i love y'all. hi. little better than yesterday i think. shrug. I had a dream that I was holding your face in my hands and giving it soft kisses all over, . and you looked so unimaginably gorgeous (because you are unimaginably gorgeous). and you were blushing a bit. <3. https://i.imgur.com/P3blZxp.gifv. what's the difference between a dirty bus stop and a lobster with boobs. one's a crusty bus station and the other's a busty crustacean. i love you too <3. i gotta get ready to go to . bork <3. good. <3. love love love <3. i already love you lots, <3. we didn't really have a "thanksgiving dinner". we had halal for lunch and chicken parm for dinner. shrugs. oh my gosh~. rolls onto back and presents tums. that's not weird at all~. that's incredible <3. i love you too~. gently~. i want you to come up behind me an nibble and suckle on my neck and kiss me while your hands wander and grope~. yes please <3. press me against the wall and put your hands up my shirt. unf~. puppy likes buns. oh gosh~. i fantasize about that actually. making out while you finger me and i moan. fuck me how? i dunno if my parts are great at it but I'd try~. nods. i'm mostly subby, but sometimes I'm not. i like being teased and played with . like a good girl. <3. i'm not good with taking charge in sexual situations. or being dommy. can i share a fantasy. being dommy to you and me, , at the same time...you with your choker, me with my collar...us both being teased and pressing against . yeah~. oh gosh. absolutely. 100& love <3. well, not necessarily like, inflicting pain or anything. just...exerting some kind of control? giving us direction. taking the lead. hgnnnnnngggh. oh my gosh. wiggles. i have this fantasy of and i being naked...on our hands and knees, right next to each other, presenting for you, . <3. pants and whimpers. or even in a non-kinky sense...just fantasizing about you sitting in my lap, (or me sitting in yours) as we make out gently and hold each other. <3. are youo kay, ? love you too. offers gentle holds. my lovely perfect birb wife. i want to hold your hand every day and spend my moments with you and make you smile. i wanna fall asleep while holding hands. and wake up and nuzzle against each other. and get up and go make breakfast and then take a shower, maybe together~. not even sexual or anything, just...intimate as we do tihngs together. yes please <3. fantasizing about...being at work and you come have lunch with us. yes please <3. bork. i suppose y'all don't understand, in terms of more specific than just referring to Islamic dietary law, what I mean when I say "halal food" in the context of NYC? so basically, it's rice with some meat (chicken/lamb usually) on top, with salad (lettuce + tomato) in the same box, often with onion, and then drizzled with a very specific kind of tangy white sauce and often a hot red sauce as well. there are as many variations and individual carts (it's pretty much a food you get at food trucks/carts) as there are New Yorkers. the term is overloaded - while 'halal' does mean the same thing as Kosher with regards to Islam, "halal food" also takes on the above meaning in the context of NYC food. it's....so....good. yes!!! i eat it all the time. they often also offer sandwich forms. halal food is a NYC institution. <3333. yayyyyy. //www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/51-reasons-you-know-youre-a-real-new-yorker this is actually pretty damn accurate. New Yorkers say "on line" as opposed to "in line". ie, "I was standing on line at the bodega waiting for my bagel...". do you know what an egg cream is? mmmm. ice-cold milk, seltzer water, and chocolate syrup. all mixed together. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_New_York_City. New Yorkers sort of have a love affair with red velvet. and pork buns. and ramen. the best bagels...and pretzels.. we will NOT be eating hot dogs at any street vendors. they boil them in water and keep them there and it's gross. we WILL be eating hot dogs from the infinitely superior Papaya King/Gray's Papaya, which have pretty darn good dogs. oh gosh~. name a cuisine and we have it. from a country, and we'll have it. heck~. oh. so it wasn't her fault? she didn't rob you? love love. wags. bork <3. licks. i love y'all so much. i love you too. when we're back in NYC. in , remember? <3. what do y'all define as "yelling". if someone got flustered after being asked a serious of questions and said, maybe with a slightly louder voice "I'm sorry, I don't know, Ican't give you the answer". would you call that "yelling". mmm. yeah. i was answg 's questions about something she read on my screen. and she kept asking - not maliciously -and i got kind of overwhelmed and was like "I don't know, I'm sorry, i gave all the answers". idk. it wasn't malicious or bad or anything. i didn't mind her looking at my screen, we have that mutual understanding. and she said i was yelling at her. and i'm not sure if I'm right to feel like I wasn't or if I am and I'm somehow bad and abusive. she wasn't interrogating me. just asking about a situation she was reading about on my screen. like, reading about something that happened and like. "why would they do X, was Y factor at play" (nothing major, it was actually about your train conductor yelling about no more boarding). 'was the train full, why would the conductor do that'. and i said that I didn't no and when asked more on the topic I was just like "I'm sorry, Ican't give you more answers " and was a bit flustered. maybe I did yell. i don't know . boooork. takes the _'s hand. bork. love my lovely loves. loves? bork !!!!! we love uou love you love you looooove youu. yes. leaving at 6:30 homeward bound. curls in your lap. !!!!! woah. <33333. did you see it? nods.

"we can't cut off ties with family" kind of thing. Angela (non bio mom) and Michele (bio mother) had LOTS of feuds over each others' respective biological families. Angela's family was super shitty to Michele and Angela's grandmother had kind of tormented Michele a lot. , yah. errr, by "you can't be too frank" i mean "it is inadvisable to be honest about your feelings". heh. we moved to a new town and moved into a new house when I was in 6th grade to caretake Angela's grandmother who was experiencing onset of alzheimer's. that caused some tension, for sure. and Angela's grandmother was HORRIBLE to me and my biological mother. everything had to be her way, she would berate Michele, there was constant tension. i got bullied a lot/had no friends in the new town. it was a fucking podunk rural town in Middle Of Fucking Nowhere, New York. i had no friends and nothing to do . and had to live with an asshole 65-year old woman who hated me and my biological mother. but talking about it with Angela was apparently taboo. Michele couldn't really even bring it up without it devolving into fighting. sigh. love. looking at streetview of old neighborhoos. dunno why. //hangouts.google.com/call/cvkueaiajncunos2mva6bcgfmee. //drive.google.com/open?id=0B6FkgM0PmGcgRVNEMDF3RmZsOTg. 260 seconds). it's Auropea, not Europe. //i.imgur.com/MGKpBSE.gif. //www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xynvrod0P6k. //scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15202740_1847379762175032_5764478640833607020_n.jpg?oh=d2ce7bf34345344236162f745922ac8e&oe=58BAB713. //www.facebook.com/pg/Undertale-%EF%BC%B3%EF%BD%94%EF%BD%81%EF%BD%99-%EF%BC%A4%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%94%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%92%EF%BD%8D%EF%BD%89%EF%BD%8E%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%84-1555907661378375/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1663717247264082. //drive.google.com/open?id=0B6FkgM0PmGcgNk00R2V1dnlEWU0.

I'm clearly not going to hear you. //pagalini.tumblr.com/post/154394031192/skookumthesamoyed-i-love-my-weird-little-human. it am me. <3. does a wifepounce. three wife, actually. three wives for the price of two. <333333. <3. >_> i was gonna write you a really sensual intimate note on yr question on yr nsfw tumblr, .... but i accidentally hit enter too soon >_>. <3. yes. i wanted to send her a nice intimate sensual thing... on her tumblr. yeah? <33333. pounces. ^. <3. love love. love you <. <3. yeah, i went to the washroom. and am watching a video at the same time >_>. of course i love the <3. the bestest birb. !!! <33333. aww. curls around. wags. <3. nuzzles a . <3. saaaaammmieeeee. porgammins. okay <3. what text editor do you feel best about. okay. you can use whichever editor you like. do you have Python3 installed on your machine. //repl.it/languages/python3. it's a repl. read-eval-print-loop. kinda functions like an IDE but it's good for quick little get-up-and-go. we'll do a Google hangouts and screen share in a bit? hmm.... good question. gimme a sec. heh. hehehe. in all honesty...maybe a few algorithm problems. <3. love you. so happy to teach you. we can or we can just play around with cmd line. whichever you think would be easiest.

Not_Die_Hard. hihi. (. what happened? i'm confused and worried. remember that weirdo who contacted me last night? no. i do not remember this. i remember the dd/lg weirdo who followed you and that's all. you and i never spoke about this . and if you and I did then I have a serious case of the memory issues. (. that seems weird and gross. oka. *okay. i love y'all. okay. yeah. clings to . did i do something wrong/have i made anyone upset at me. sorry. i woke up from a bizarre series of vivid dreams and my head is still in the dreams. the more i have vivid dreams (which unisom sleep aid seems to bestow upon me) the less i want to be awake and the more I'd rather just be dreaming. i was dreaming that Pokemon Sun and Moon were real but...it was weird. it was set in the real world, kind of - an alternate real world? with Pokemon. but other fantastical things too. <3. but I was...also a pokemon? so in addition to wild pokemon there were also separate, pseudo-pokemon sapient races. er, that's true. i meant...more like your generic fantasy 'civilized' races. i was some kind of...ghost cat, from Japan, and i was in the Alola region (which was actually a lot more like Brazil?) documenting the Pokemon of this newly-discovered/poorly understood region . and was trying to write a book but my (powerful) family told me it would never sell, except for my sister, whom i was close with. because apparently the Japanese market - Japan was largely populated by ghost-type people - was hugely inested in anything ghost-related and things outside of that were more indie, less likely to achieve acclaim in the critical eye. but i was passionate about my work. and then there were entirely separate, unrelated dreams in the dream. some of which referenced each other and had me explaining the dream to other dream characters in a nested dream. it was weird. but in the Pokemon part of the dream. i was actually catching Pokemon in this dense, jungly land. diving into rivers and streams catching water pokemon. 3. oh lord. god. i can't believe some places actually do this. lord. god damn. i mean, in a literal sense I do literally believe it. what i was trying to express was. outrage, frustration. <3. i love y'all so much. oh good god. //www.youtube.com/watch?v=p78EcFQLjHo.

Neo Genesith Evangeline. that sounds exhausting ;-;. 20 blocks is nothing in nyc. i don't have the energy to write most of the time. i can code/get code done in a day. writing fiction is harder than coding. code either works correctly or it doesn't. and you can diagnose technical errors. writing requires you to output something from within yourself. also, most of my ideas are extremely grand in scope, like huge sci-fi universes that I fantasize about. <3333. lil tiny birb. bestest birb. the puppy lying on the bed wags tail and gives the birb a sniff. borks gently in puppy confusion.

Much longer than a year. i just wanted. to like. learn more and work harder. push myself. in these past 6 weeks. and all i have to show for it is a 'game' that isn't even finished. and isn't even really a 'game'. shrugs. it's still working on top of curses. it's just a stupid wrapper around curses. with a toy game engine. shrugs. it's useless. and stupid. i'm loggong off so I can focus on work. and only working on something real. and not procrastinating. love. <3333. so tired. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6FkgM0PmGcgcUVGcDBjZmdRTTQ. boooooork!!!!! grumps. Python can't handle recursion with a 2455 character string >_>. heck. what did you just figured out? <333333. heck~. lick. it meeeee. . your pictures with th black lipstick... fans self. i didn't see those!!! oh wait the video. yesssss <33333. adorable. hot. i did see that. can i say something lewd. i kinda want you to cum on my face >_>. <33333. oh my~. oooh. i'm in for the weekend (because came home from UK_. yeah. she was in UK with parents/family. (. sorry that I didn't tell you in advance. or be there more this week. (. curls. I'm a good wife, loved wife, very cared for wife, even if I don't be around/on hangouts all the time. those aren't prerequisites for being loved <3. yes please <3. i love you so so much. , can i ask you a bit of a serious question? hmm. so, you and i are both exhibitionists/like showing off our bodies to other people and I feel really good about that/that's enjoyable. something inside of me is...idk, afraid of like, either you or having lots of casual sex with strangers, for some reason - maybe because while i enjoy sex as a part of intimacy, i fear it casually and how it can impact things emotionally? if that's something you want to do I don't want you to feel like I'm stopping you/holding you back. and i encourage you to do what you want to. i just wanted to talk about these feelings. nods. nods. nods. you and i have talked about this, . i guess...i've been in relationships where there was an element of the other person having lots of sex with other people. and it felt...idk, detached, like I (and maybe for them, everyone else they were dating) were just good lays they kinda emotionally clicked with. i don't know why I feel this fear. I feel like the Proper Polyamorous™ thing to do is just be 100% okay with all of my partners' relationships without reservation . nods. yeah... hmm... it's hard. for some reason I am much less threatened with the idea of my partners' dating/making new partners. than i am just casual sex. that feels scarier. nod. because something about the realm of sex without intimacy, without care and comfort and love and trust, just /terrifies/ me. maybe. yeah... i get the urges, i get horny, I want the sex, sometimes. as a means of scratching an itch. you mean the world to me, sweetie. yeah... it's not invalid for someone ot have other reasons for wanting sex, of course. it's just...i agree with you. i find that I have a hard time...jiving emotionally with people who put a lot of time/effort into doing sexual things purely for the sexual aspect of them. or, it generally makes me at least a little worried. ihope you don't feel like I'm saying I feel unsafe with you, ... i would enjoy that very much. do you feel...stifled/threatened by what I've talked about, ? oh no, absolutely not. i wouldn't mind...to the right people~. gotcha <3. certainly between you and I we can post them to our tumblrs. me? i dunno. never been around it. i want to make love to my wives. moreso than just..."fucking". <33333. yes please. i fantasize about just...blissing out as we squrim against each other. telling each other that we love each other. holding hands and falling asleep together. <3. <3. !!!!! TR8R. activates buzz baton. "TRAITOR". borks and flops. we made a cool accomplishment today wrt coding. we did some stuff purely functionally. which we thought was intimidating... but it's not nearly as much as we thought. nuzzle. i wish there were large expanses of raw wilderness nearby. so i could just...go explore them. maybe with people. yus. there aren't many nearby. i might take a trip out to Long Island and just explore into some wilderness/one of the state parks. !!! yus~. i can't wait to wake up next to you and every day. is it weird to say... that even though we've been in love for so long...that i still want to "get to know" you and ? that i love learning more/becoming closer . do you feel like there's things about me you don't know? <3. long walks together sound nice. how do you feel aobut the idea of taking regular walks . nods. yeah...it's hard for me too. i like being indoors much more than being outside in the open. it's not so bad if there's lots of tall buildings densely packed around me. i don't like open spaces very much. unless it's like, wilderness, i guess. idk that's probably just normal. i love you too <3. heck. that's me. <333333. Mulan am good. P. yes. Gizmo was supposed to turn into Stripe. also Billy. Billy's mom was supposed to get decapitated. and we were supposed to see them eat Barney. there was also an idea for the Gremlins to be in a McDonalds, eating people instead of fast food. oh yeah, best scene in the movie. exploding-head scene made it PG-13. yes. we don't even get her name...do we? Lynn. Lynn Peltzer. her name is Lynn Peltzer. ...not an improvement over Barbara >_>. . but...i never wanna make you sad~. hah. i dunno if I have SAD but if i did would it be weird to love snow. yes please... i wanna have my tummy kissed and nibbled on... i like receiving kisses in that area between my dick and belly button. oh my~. whaddaya wanna snack on? ;). presents self for noms. what do you wanna eat first?~. which part of me would be most delicious. yeck. wiggles. what part of me you wanna eat first ? y'all love my tums. tums is very popular with wives. hng~. dessert, or the main course? ;-;. hng. gremlins 2 is a crazy movie. and is amazing. <333333. cute cute cute face. <333333. such beautiful mine wife. yes please. yes please <3. what kinda wedding y'all want? skittles are yum. heck. had to reboot. yeah.... what kinda wedding we gonna have? what kinda rituals do we want to engage in, if any? hu. yus. bork. and I are making a huge amount of fried chicken tenders/nuggets. wiggles. you're yummy~. good. happy. cooking. says she's alive. that's how she's doin'. bork. how are you, hon? :(. fireworks suck. i wish i were there to hold your hand and wrap around you and keep you safe. bork. yes please. holding hands, watching a movie/show. me spooning you bein a big bork spoon. i love cuddling. premium wife cuddles™. wow...we made so much chicken. 3 whole pounds of chicken breast turned into chicken tenders/nuggets. they're really damn good, too.... wanna cook for you and . //i.imgur.com/Glaq8uf.jpg HALLO YAS I AM REAL PORKEMAN.

"shot", that will spread out in the traditional scatter . most people think of shotguns as scatterguns, which they usually are, but they don't have to fire shot. a slug is yeah, just a big single hunk. i dunno. P. sigh. me too. did you know that NY is 5th in the US in terms of onion production?? for agriculture. and ranks first in the nation for production of yoghurt, sour cream, and cottage cheese. New York state total production of apples in 2015 was over 1.35 billion pounds of apples. ...sorry, I spent most of today looking up the agricultural statistics for the US, mostly NY >_>. all. all the kinds of apples. NY apples are so good. yes :>. we can go apple picking. NY orchards often act as tourist locations in addition to being places where you can pick your own apples. get a bag, load up on cheap apples, pay per pound. they usually have like a building/barn where they sell other stuff that's been produced on the local farm. cheese, butter, maple candy, maybe some honey . yes~. it's not a winter thing...more of a fall thing. just means you gotta come during september <3. NY apple cider is some of the best, though. :(. . what does your garden grow usually. hipster is complicated. bork. <3. still in but maybe. i'm sleepin' by myself tonight, we went through the rotations of sleeping partners. i told you already. well... usually plays World of Warcraft until 7am and so and don't sleep together much. so I end up sleeping with one of those two when I visit them. but 's been away for like a month so she wants to sleep with for a night or two. also, 's bed is not big enough to sleep three comfortably. okay <3. sweetie... . i love you for you. sex is not a necessary part of our relationship. just loving you and caring for you and being with you is what I want <3. you're my wife and 's wife and we want you. sex is much less important than caring for each other and being together and sharing our lives . gently rests head in lap. heh. yeah~. <3. exactly. exactly what said. "butt stuff" is like, one of the last things I think about when i think about being with you. holding you close...listening to you and making you feel loved...providing for you. helping you feel safe. helping you feel understood and valid and happy. those are way better~. me. i'm sorry . chocolate milk is yum. pudding is also yum. would you accept rice pudding if we made some for you, ? maybe some chocolate-covered shortbread cookies. heck. <3. bork. i love y'all. probably. yes pleeeeease <3. sorry do i talk to y'all enough. interact with y'all. message, hangouts, spend time, etc. what thing. but yes wanna. cuddles. me too. i like kisses. kisses and pressing up close. eeee~. yes please. i wanna be in a cuddly wifepile with y'all. just nuzzling and telling each other we love . god yes. hmm...that sounds perfect :>. e<3. yu. lemme get set up. http://www.battlebotsupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/s6e1_lisa.jpg. love y'all. bork. bork wuff heck sniff. bork. are you okay . :(. i love you. sorry. is there anything I can do. okay. i'll be home tonight. hello welcome. i am bup. welcome to bup. wives wives wives. yes. hyes <3. wiggle. i love you <3. rwoqpekgjfdnwi0qr-opkjbdhwiqr90-3wofksbg. wait. whaaaaaat.

I bet would get a kick out of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6fceLfjB4s. noone. we were talking about violent intrusive thoughts/fantasies we have. it's hard to deal with. it's easier NOT to try to deliberately push them away, though. you can buy them in subway stations at machines that accept cards and/or cash. some stores also sell them but this is less commonly done. yes, if you do not exit via turnstiles, you can stay in the subway indefinitely and transferring. so, you want to get to a station that has a transfer to the service you so desire. <33333. yes. well. don't buy 'single rides'. they're more expensive than just putting individual monies on the card. yeah. yeah <3. frowns. "you're new to Python, right?". no, not really, i just forgot that string.replace() doesn't mutate in place. i feel like this person who was just helping me assumed I was a beginner just because I forgot the behaviour of a stdlib function. such wonderful meepmorps. and the uke! //www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAkf4B_Ff3M.

Cat! iliek your hair. has amazing hair. Simon and Garfunkel are pleasant musicians. Naga, go? to hospital. mmm. it was some mistake I should never have made. i KNOW the way X thing works. i guess it's because I've been socializing and thinking and doing things all day and my brain is fogged. idk. it wasn't at work or anything. it was while pair programming for some little fun activity. and I can't help but be mad at myself. i feel like a shit programmer. i know.... i know it doesn't mean much. it's just some random thing I did after hours of socialization. which already has me a bit frazzled. yay. that's a happy. hi kye. are you okay? though YMMV absolutely. wheeee. sporpsbol. gets petted. more pls!!!! wagg!! sigh. i just want things to be good and cool for everybody. my first act as president would be to dismantle the gov't. and everybody work on mutual aid. and no more capitalism . weighted blanekts for everyone. no more neoliberalism, no more wars. i'm officially endorsing Weight Blanket for president 2020. with their running mate, Chewy Stimtoy. lizards are good little pups. yes. you good photograffer. can we just try and hold off. this is causing a lot of people anxiety. can we do no more election talk? me fucking too MiseryMyra. err, . mio. we're all fucking stressed. lots of people are afraid. and have the right to be. many of our freedoms will suffer. yours are valid too. yeah many of us don't need more stress from constant reports of awful things happening. i love y'all. i just want to go to sleep. i love you all. i love you Dragoness. i'm here for you. wraps around the naddo. I'm wondg if I should use WHONIX instead of MacOs. OSX is fine. oh? what's megestrol? I positively cannot believe the people who think that Trump is "keeping LGBT people safe from the radical Islamic terroristS". i just. i don't understand it. yeah... I think cultivating a certain degree of distrust of everyone around you might not be a bad idea. idk though. stay safe, . be well and we love you. Modi is horrifying... While I agree re: Modi - did you have something specific in mind when you said that? oh, just...was reading about the whole 500/1000 rupee thing. just about stuff he'd been doing. i was reading an article. can they exchange the bills to smaller ones? , most people here might not know what lac/crore are: would you mind explaining? . curls around . holy shit. http://www.clickhole.com/article/taking-stand-disney-will-add-donald-trump-its-anim-5143. "Being a company that caters to diverse families, we felt it was a moral responsibility to have Mr. Trump’s robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations, while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death.". alternate plan, replace trump with the robot. the old switcheroo. like, why torture an innocent robot when you can torture trump himself. mm... yeah. probably just not good for her to talk about/be around. it's okay. honey.... sigh... they don't understand that Trump is placing vehemently anti-LGBT people in positions of power. they don't understand that a Trump win is emboldening the KKK and white nationalists. do they not understand? or do they not care. they don't understand that "radical islam" is in many ways due to US intervention and imperialism. individual trump supporters might not hate queer people. but so many do... they don't understand the basis of so many societal issues. the whole "globalist" thing is really awful... like, the way they think about it. i mean like. neoliberalism does suck. idk.... do you think there are Trump supporters who really truly think queer people will be safe? i mean, maybe they do...but they don't understand that the current climate is going to really undo so much of that. i dunno. i mean, they don't understand. that like, many people don't like Trump OR Clinton. why are people so awful. why is humanity such shit. i can't help but feel somewhat guilty that I didn't do more to give emotional labour to people who might support Trump. and try and convince them away from it? i mean like. so many problems with hillary too. i wish there were a foolproof way to protect against state actors. like, one thing that the_donald was saying re: the KKK is "oh but Hillary called some KKK guy her mentor!". it's all like...they pull out things they hate as an anti-Hillary thing but can't even attempt to consider the scary implications of the KKK endorsing Trump? i dunno. i think i'm trying too hard. i know... i mean like I have no great love for Hillary either. they're both criminals. yeah... despite being kind of an ass about some things I think we need to all be following RMS's advice more. Richard Stallman. head of the Free Software Foundation. really big into encryption, privacy, etc. oh just like. all of it. basically, "free software, privacy for users, user control of programs". he doesn't use like, key-fobs at work because of the potential for tracking. uses plain metal key to get into the building. he's THAT kind of guy. yeah true. RMS is a bit...off . in some things. wut. in a biology thing or a furry thing. an RMS thing, I think. oh. i'm not surprised. oh right. ohhhhhhh right. it's the whole "no censorship of any kind!". "all information should be free". yeah... i forgot about that. yeah it's like. he'd literally be in favour of legalized/protections for like, the free exchange of kiddie porn. not the people who raped kids! but the possession of the content itself and distribution of it. it's not really about RMS and squicky stuff...it's about the fact that he wants to protect content that violates and abuses people. on the principle of freedom of information. ALL information, all content, regardless of what it is. though he's also really big into privacy... so... he's...kind of a fuck. unfortunately in times like these. sometimes it is inevitable that we cause suffg as a reaction to protect ourselves. very high. waffle? where were the white men saying that we need to give Obama a chance. the exact same white men were calling Obama the antichrist. let's hope a Trump presidency doesn't strip that away. Have you been here before, MSax? Ah. Well, welcome. yeah... i would recommend getting that done ASAP. do you have name/gender marker change paperwork? yeah...it sucks. ugh. ughhhhhhh. god i'm so sory for you. i dunno. i really can't say... i worked at the GAP a few years ago and was there for a year, and no one said anything about taxes/markers/etc, and I hadn't changed anything . but in Texas... nods. it's hard. and unfortunately i can't promise that it won't get harder. what I can promise is that there will be people looking out for you that will fight for you. at least you don't get the dreaded, spoken-with-venom "what are you, a man or a woman". nods. may i ask where you work/what it is you do? nods. do you get free ice cream? bork. Neoliberalism failed the working class of the United States and Trump seized upon that anger and pain and disappointment. Sadly, he won't be able to deliver on his promises. And the white middle/working class people will soon realize this. doggooooo. and yes, we are surrounded by fascists. offers hug to Audrey_Emma. you're not being difficult. 3, as in 3 individuals. or 3 million individuals. i hate capitalism and the US political machine. by default. kitty. yep. kitty good. :(. mirrors are a lie invented by the Luxembourgish . yikes. , maybe you should poll the entire room. instead of putting individuals on the spot. it might make one person feel really overly focused on in a situation. or uncomfy. >two people living in my brain. OH BOY I WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. :D. heck. I've been having such a hard time expressing myself verbally lately. I start conversations or say things and people just look confused/have a hard time figuring out what I'm saying. I was trying to explain how I want to learn more embedded programming, and I was trying to express the idea that with an Arduino, I have a much better concept of what I can do/what is possible, but I feel intimidated by like, embedded stuff. and the person I was talking to looked so confused at what I was saying like it was barely comprehensible. someone please talk to me. did anyone like. read it. i have a hard time interacting too. what I just said. I know that there's nothing fundamentally wrong with my understanding of things. but my ability to actually explain things lately is just fucking shot. I'm in a state of constant anxiety lately. worrying that I or the people I love will be shipped off to a death camp or something. I tried to ask someone last night "Hey, are you also waiting (by the door) to go get food?" because a bunch of people were going to get food together. and what came out was absolutely incomprehensible. apparently. I generally prefer to communicate via text. It's easier for me to see what I'm saying and then adjust it if I realize there's an error. and it's not like I don't think before I speak, which is such a silly thing to recommend to people in this kind of predicament. getting to not wearing a bra for 3 months is gonna be awesome. I managed to write something that can read from a socket. and actually got it to display . no. she needs to stop doing that, also. kitty <3. sigh. there was a police siren just now that was running with a very sustained tone and it sounded like some sort of air raid siren . holy heck. these corn fritters are really good. all of these fuckers who are saying "The Army Corps of Engineers and others signed off the Dakota Access Pipeline as being safe!" need to shut the fuck up and never speak again. of course they're going to sign it off as safe. eyyyyyyyup. who's edie? oh. right. i'm scared of pain . regardless of whether or not that's what they want, i kinda don't care because I just want to avoid pain. someone please tell me something lovely and encouraging and sweet and cute. is nice, ja. what's that. not prozac, but "yawngasms". a person named 'virr' is in the lobby. should I try to see if they're an okay person first before inviting them. they are asking to be invited. aww. curl. glass| can i ask u question. plurality-related. is that ok? how do u manage individual interests/etc, if that's something you do. like, we feel like we mostly just like/do the same things. and it's not a good feeling. blendyness and such not fun or good. but? mmm. there's only two of us here (as far as know) so.... mm. mmm. is it wrong of me to be annoyed at people who almost exclusively only ever message me to talk about things related to themselves. no one here in this channel does this nor is it about any of you, to be clear. i mean like. actually it's only one person. who i get weird feels about because iwant them to like me more. i shouldn't have couched it as being about people in geenral. i don't know why I did that. it's actually literally just one person on Facebok i'm talking about. sorry. well, it depends on what you're doing. it's not a hard and fast rule. yeah. ni. today is bad. c. friend died. trolls have somehow invaded the fucking facebook post she used as her suicide note. and are posting horrific things. *their suicide note. i didn't notice pronoun switch, it must have been recent. nope. well, that's not true... they used IRC actually. i have no idea. how would I know that? oh. i believe they went by LizzyQueer or something similar. i mostly interacted with them on FAcebook. A lot. they were amazing and wonderful. (. it's 1pm. did you already eat dinner/. bork. i am bork, more or less. shurgs. heck. cars suck. America is ridiculous and doesn't unederstant the value of public transport. it's that "rugged individualism". i don't really care about the holiday of Thanksgiving itself but i do sort of wish i could have the "everyone get together to share a meal and be happy together" experience again. HECK YR BUTT INTO A BED SLEEPAMY. ugh, Mio... that was very inappropriate when other people are talking about their experiences with abuse. , no... enby POC exist... people of color who use neopronouns exist... it's like. the gender binary is a white supremacist Western construct anyway. offers many hugs and pets and loves to . you are wonderful and that person is awful. you did nothing wrong. we love you becca. what does that mean. "no more boarding". ugh. was it full? no. Emma_Audrey, you are allowed to want your body to be whatever you want. wanting/having boobs is not a prerequisite for being a woman. and not liking/not having breasts does not invalidate a person as a woman. bork. did you get another job? okay. are you getting paid? noms on peanuts. slathers in gochujang. i could eat gochujang out of a jar. it cold. take a minute to calm down, breathe, have a glass of water, etc. yikes. (. i love you . , take a breather, get some water, etc - might not alleviate these feelings entirely but it'll make you feel slightly better. yes it does. please take some time to self-care. does it count as pica if we used to eat, regularly, grass/twigs/leaves/paper/insects. and would sort of just do it whenever given the opportunity. no you don't. Pseudicus Latinium. For Grandus Effectarium Dramatica. hiii. goddamn beer hipsters fucking Chicago beer snob assholes. you call a brewery "revolution brewing" and put all this anticapitalist coded imagery everywhere. //revbrew.com/home. and it turns out it's just marketing/symbols and you're not actually commies/anarchists? i can't find any actual indication that any of the imagery is anything more than just for marketing. that they're actually down for the revolution. steal all their bourgie beer and drink it in Haymarket Square. doesn't look like they are. a co-op, that is. I'd rather a tall raktajino. next time she comes back. I'm not letting that slide. stop it and listen to us for a moment. no. nothing is more fucking annoying than when you are profoundly autistic and have extreme difficulty extracting the meaning from what people tell you. and they get frustrated that you need to literally re-explain what they said to them to make sure you understood it. also. i fucking hate "oh, I thought it was obvious that I was saying X when I said <thing>". i hate hate hate it. MAYBE IT'S NOT SO FUCKING OBVIOSU!!!!!!!! i was trying to get help with a programming concept from a friend. there was a central concept i didn't understand because i misinterpreted what someone said. and they said "oh, I thought it was obvious that I meant X". curls around . i was trying to be really polite i think. i dunno, I just hate that people get frustrated with me when i don't understand. (. also, hi . , still here? you do not look like a man . someone is trying to argue with me that I shouldn't joke about "white people spicy chicken wings" because white people invented buffalo wings. which aren't even that spicy to begin with. "I'm white and I love buffalo wings". , the stereotype of white people is that they mostly cannot handle spicy food. //www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/spice-lover-orders-mild-curry-6506732. it was more about the spice level, , than the wings themselves. well i'd say that's more a hypermasculinity thing than reflective of white 'culture' as a whole. garbanzos are good. the joke is also that white people as a whole underseason food. Drey_Emma, no, of course not. but it's...reflective of the blandness of 'whiteness' as a whole. how things that get subsumed into whiteness become associated with blandness and plainness. //www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/23/291525991/when-vanilla-was-brown-and-how-we-came-to-see-it-as-white.  i wonder that too. I think gulyásleves still was a thing just not very paprika-y. onions and caraway and carrots, it looks? i drink worcestershire sauce . i love mustard. i'm kind of a spice fanatic. sometimes I like to just fuck my face and sinuses up right proper. sour is amaze.  agree or disagree, capsicum is the greatest edible plant. handstands noo. I'm a big fan of complex flavours. , did you know that telling jokes about orthography is most fun if you do it in a grave accent. orthography jokes are so fun, except when people are overly diacritical of them. i could tell linguistics jokes all day long, but i'd rather do them spoken, because in text you wouldn't get any sense of inflection. and if that were the case, it might make things a bit tense. sorty. *sorry. okay. I'm just a bit lonely today. hi Dragoness. <3. and yeah, the societal expectation/norm os that neurodivergent people are bad. burdens. sick, disgusting. crazy. ??? they said WHAT? oh man. i did NOT know that this writing community I was a part of. has so many communists in it. ☭☭☭☭☭. <333333. eeee! coming over in what capacity, though? where'd you be staying. I remember you having a guest room. but there's also your roommates... ooooh, maybe talk to and , ? but i don't wanna grow up to be wally bear. i wanna grow up to be me. I wanna be just like when I grow up. looks dreamily at . hmm...can i aspire to marry you, then? <3. .... she should fucking enjoy giving the gift because YOU want it. get her a bag of celery for christmas. "this makes me happy to give you!". "i enjoyed giving this gift". 260 seconds). am I bi if I occasionally look at gay furry art with boy furries. i'm actually pretty ace tbh. hi Snowmew. you is snowmew? hi. nope. snuggles FaeFennec. bork. , you are. cis people don't ask that. it's not a thing that enters into the cis realm of thought. studies? idk. why do you ask. but like, literally, people who are cis do not spend the amount of energy you do. on questioning/feeling invalid. cis people just don't really care/it's not a thing that they think of at all. yeah. 1.2 years of pain and hardship and having it dominate yr thinking. cis people don't do that. congration. not everyone picks up on/understands body language though __. right. righ. *right. yeah, though. that's kind of not what i think  was asking. "is it ableist to use the term voiceless because of people who might be incapable of producing audio via speech". yup, that's what I was thinking when I asked the question. well, that's what  was asking. and trying to figure out. what rhetoric is that. i don't understand. can you please concretely clarify the word/phrase/term you are proposing be a replacement for "voiceless". well, this isn't just about first amendment. this could apply to any country or any marginalized group, I think. so yeah. , i totally get where you are coming form. *from. I'd say "subaltern" could be a word to replace it potentially but I'm unsure of that's deviating from its original postcolonialist meaning. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaltern_(postcolonialism). a subaltern is a person rendered without agency by social status.[. right. i'm well aware of what  meant by it. well, though. read the "denotations" section and what Gayatri Spivak had to say. i'm just not sure. yes, of course. but I'm just saying "I'm not sure if it is most advantageous to use that specific definition or to use it broadly". , who would you consider "voiceless", specificaly? , what do you mean? i don't think non-speaking people need to express a problem with it for it to be a point of consideration. or for us to examine the potential ableism within everyday terminologies. I was thinking of trans people for example. Or... I'm currently also thinking of how, on FB yaraju feels "voiceless" coz coming out will lead to all kinds of repercussions. i'm looking at a few articles that challenge the idea of "voicelenessness" altogether and suggest that there are only the deliberately unheard, the silenced. or, to be precise, those who are deliberately left unconsidered or restricted from being able to discuss/communicate/etc. well, by "communicate" I meant "unable to discuss their issues/have their issues recognized by society at large". right, yes, that. i've come to be fond of powers of 2. yeah. da. idk, i'm not an expert on colonial theory. but i think the original idea was that there was a colonizer/colonized relationship. and that...the colonized people could not have their voices heard except filtered through the lens of the colonizer? though it also seems like a fuzzy term. i think one of my friends described it as..."a group that has not reached the level where their participation in political discourse is even considered/paid attention to". or something like that. so i think there's a disparity between a narrow, specific view, and a broader view. i'm not sure which seems the most useful in the context of this discussion. my friend suggested, for instance, that plural people are subaltern because their voices aren't even considered or acknowledged as existing as being relevant to the discourse about things affecting them. and if people are discussing plurality, it's entirely filtered through the lens of how society views it, such that plurality itself becomes defined by the majority. yeah, is 'subaltern' just a term for marginalized people, or does it refer to a group that is so far under the radar that the very concept of their existence is defined in the social hegemony by the majority? ah. here we go. //www.academia.edu/3644590/Can_the_Subaltern_Speak-_Summary. yeah, that seems to hit upon it, . "The "subaltern" always stands in an ambiguous relation to power-subordinate to it but never fullyconsenting to its rule, never adopting the dominant point of view or vocabulary as expressive of its ownidentity.". i think for this reason, a lot of people feel more comfortable identifying with "queer" rather than specific acronyms. i know i certainly feel better about that. ! that's me. ). thank you.

"you understand what I meant" is pretty much entirely a bad thing to say to someone. yes. right. that might be the only possible valid usage. also. if someone asks you to clarify something you said/asks you directly what you are telling them to do. telling them "what do you think/go read what I said again/etc" is shitty. do people often conflate "you're not listening to what I'm saying" with the person they're talking to not understanding what they said? hmm. i think that's definitely often true. but what I meant was "do you think it is possible that some people conflate listening with understanding". and will accuse someone of not listening to them when they are not being agreed with, or when the person they're talking to doesn't understand them? irrespective of the phenomenon of people talking over others, etc. not to say that this is always what people mean when they say 'you're not listening' or that it is even true in most cases. but moreso, is it possible that it could be true in some cases, and have you ever experienced it? sorry . do i qualify as learning disabled? you did nothing wrong, i'm sorry, i had to get up and couldn't get quassel not to crash on my phone (common problem). okay. sometimes i feel that communicating with humans is a worthless endeavour. it's especially hard when I try to clarify precisely what i mean after every turn. and people act like I'm stupid for that. <33333. <3 . iii~. howdy. good, you? mmm. that sounds yum. i'm a big fan of sauteeing cabbage. cabbage is good. i can get savoy cabbages at the market for $1.50 a head. cabbage is best consumed sauteed imo. do you ever just feel like... a great disdain for humanity in general. ooh nice. aww. curls around FaeFennecs.

BUP. wiggles. just saw Rogue One. amaze. simply purely amaze. <3. is Tumblr weirdly not loading the HTML/CSS properly for some blogs. wait, who's getting married, AliceMarie? oh. well technically. heh. is it wrong of me to think that it is...perhaps an overly limiting thing for someone to say "I won't watch the new Star Wars movies/The Force Awakens because i know I'll think the originals were better and nothing will ever live up in my opinion". no... i didn't say anything about there being anything wrong, . i just am trying to grok that mindse. *mindset. because i like to judge things on their own merits. and while i love Star Wars and have even gotten into EU kind of stuff at times, there's no reason to me why new content made by different people couldn't be good. well, i mean, in terms of transphobic/racist/awful shit, yeah. like what? i saw the first...two? . the first two hobbit films. and yeah, they lost the spirit of LotR something fierce. but i'm glad i saw them (I didn't pay money to see them, i watched them on DVD or whatever after the fact). yeah..... the hobbit movies went off the rails so much... wow... oh, yeah, no one *owes* movies a view. i'm just trying to put myself into that mindset/understand it. because I personally would rather watch something and say "that was trash" than not watch it, because heck, there are people who find trash enjoyable. or maybe I am one of the few who don't find it trash at all and i eat it up like. i thought the first new one was kinda fun in some ways but also kinda trash. and then Into Darkness was *really* trash. and i haven't seen Beyond, though people have said it's very oldtrek. so i can't judge. meh, it's not like a big plot point so i think yr okay. the idea of a Trek reboot is not a bad idea, fundamentally. but i think it was poorly handled. would been better to have a movie that segues directly into a TV show, in my opinion >_>. , Rogue One was fantastic. I cant wait to see it with you and ina few weeks! <3333. i wanna see it again. we have to see A New Hope directly after tho. oooh. yeh. that sounds nice. <3333. if we ever do watch the prequels, I suggest doing it "hatchet order" . which is A New Hope -> Empire Strikes Back -> Attack of the Clones -> Revenge of the Sith -> Return of the Jedi. yeah, but cut out Phantom Meance. *Menace. yeah... because Attack of the Clones, despite sucking, introduces Anakin better than Menace. and does set the stage for the downfall of Anakin, etc. me too, mostly... oooh yeah. that one isn't bad. though the "Skips" thing with Ahsoka Tano is a bit hard to get by...Anakin seems like a Pretty Okay Dude in the Clone Wars cartoon from what I've seen, which i guess isn't bad, but do they portray any of his downfall? i like the *idea* of the story of Anakin Skywalker and the fall of the old republic, is the thing. i like to laugh at the prequels. it's like watching Plan 9. i think the prequels could have been amazing had George Lucas not had a army of yespeople attending to his every whim. i want to travel into the alternate reality where the prequels where amazing masterpieces of cinema . i keep trying to move objects with my mind and being really...dejected that it doesn't work. even though I know it won't work. why can't we just have like, individual stalls with doors that close all the way. and no spacing underneath the dividers. like, that seems sensible. jumps up, shouting "EUREKA!". i finally figured out what the bug in my program was!!!!!!!!!!! well yeah. i've done it many times before. it happens all the time. this one was just...a particularly annoying one that had been plaguing me for several days. capitalist society definitely exploits and objectifies workers. extraction of surplus value from workers is a cornerstone of capitalism. god bless what. is that sarcasm. are you being sarcastic by saying "god bless capitalism", janet. or was that a legitimate defense. why? by "extraction of surplus value" I mean of course the idea of buying a worker's labour at less than what it's worth. and using it to create profit for the capitalist. no, i think it's indefensible. i think capitalism is a blight upon the planet. why shouldn't labour have the right to all it produces? why should we have no ownership over the means of production, as workers? Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks. The time during which the labourer works, is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has purchased of him. capitalism is inherently oppressive and disgusting. it is efficient at exploitation. i don't care how much capitalism produces if it is at the expense of exploitation of labourers. if it as the expense of the good working people. *at the expense. why should i labour for another who underpays me for what I have produced to profit for themself? why should the capitalist own the means of production - the machines, the tools with which things are produced - and leave me no power in directing my own labour, or any participation in what I have produced? janet. capitalism is not an inevitability of humanity. well. capitalism developed under a certain set of conditions. and in a certain context, is the thing. most people don't even really understand capitalism. or marxism, or communism. which makes sense, intentional misinformation by the capitalists . no need. what annoys me just is much are people who are like. "leftists are such hypocrites because they dismiss communist failures as "not really being communist"". when like. even the USSR didn't claim to be communist. they're socialist. there's a very specific language/meaning of words here. also what. more like "imagine that you exist in a society where people are divided into social categories and the division of labour corresponds to the division in classes..". "...and you contribute your labour to produce useful cow-related commodities such as milk, beef, leather, etc". "and the class of people who own the means of production - the people who own the milking equipment and farms - buy your labour for a price less than its value and turn a profit". actually i want to correct the cow metaphor now. communism is stalin killing eleventy billion people. weird. nice. mmm. some spicy, sweet bbq beans sound good right now. i saw it. he believes that child porn distribution should be legal. not producing it. but selling the already-existing content, viewing it, sharing it. etc. ...fucked up . it's a religion, i'm pretty sure you can engage in it if you so choose. hi AlexanderPanda. okay, you? oh this looks nice http://inpursuitofmore.com/2016/09/19/pasta-with-creamy-vegan-rose-sauce/. does it count as a flashback if i space out and started heavily reminiscing on things from the past, still being cognizant that i'm living in the present. mmm. i thought flashbacks required like. feeling like you're there. seeing it happen as if it's happening all over again. nevermind. let's stop talking about it. ... no, it's not you. it *is* ridiculous. no, it'll be some complicated historical reference. like a reference to something that happened when Konami got its start. something obscure and ~intellectual~. The voice actor for Bear from Bear in the Big Blue House sounds ever so slightly like David Wain. heh. l-l-l-look at you, amy. a c-c-cute creature of sweetness and trans. how can you challenge a perfect, adorable wuffs. (I'm quoting Shodan, of course). no. "look at you, hacker, a pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you run through my corridors". yeck. hi. heck. are you talking about Lizzy. a trans woman living in South Dakota. trolls showing up on their suicide note. etc. oh...different person then. yeah, her. because people /think/ they killed themself because of kiwifarms but it's not true...and i don't want their memory tarnished. why would they revel in that. i just can't understand it. i wish we were together. i don't ever shave my legs. what are cats. i just realized that my intense isolation/loneliness as a kid was exacerbated by gender norms about who a boy can/can't socialize with to a certain degree. oh, it's ~weird/embarassing~ to make friends with the ~weird girls~ because you gotta be friends with only the girls you could envision yourself dating. plush? 3. Qapla'! <3. i dunno...maybe some sorta foxie, ~. or...a raccoon. or a snow leopard! 3. <- pup. sometimes a fox. generally wuffy. don't wanna be human. //cobbledstories.tumblr.com/post/154680303992/i-had-a-vivid-dream-that-bart-canonically-got-a. 252 seconds). urgent care? are you ok. what happened, . that's good. ??? who was this on fb. that's weird... yeah, just block them maybe? i have no idea. is your fb restricted/lock down to all friends-only, ? ugh. you don't even have naked photos of anyone related to alannah. yeah, i'd recommend locking everything you have down. set your fb everything to be visible to friends-only. etc. :(. I want to be a witch but I don't know that I have the capacity for faith or spirituality or even just to do it because I want to. kinda. why. mmm. in what way. i don't think from what I know of witches, that all witches are interested in those. i think 'witch' is kind of a broad term? i didn't say there AREN'T witches who are into chemistry and pharm. just, i don't think it's a defining necessary feature of a witch. anyway that's kind of irrelevant. idk. something, anything. i have things I'm drawn to and like the idea of bringing magic/ritual into. cooking, coding, cleaning, fire, the moon. but i don't know that I have enough faith to believe in anything beyond the material world or engage in that kind of thing. shrugs. i guess. but I'm talking about like...spells and magic and stuff that most people think of. you know, there are some people who believe/engage in the power of that sort of thing beyond that which science can currently explain. i understand your point, but. I'm just saying it's hard for me to have faith because I've seen no evidence of forces beyond those currently explainable by science. what? i don't understand the question. that would be interesting. I don't know if I'd be disappointed. maybe? I personally don't feel very enraptured or in awe of like, bosons or linear algebra. it doesn't feel magical to me. okay well. i'm talking about me and my particular feelings on the matter. it doesn't feel magical to me and that's causing me distress. it's...it's the idea of cold, unfeeling forces that exist without any sort of spirit or emotion. it's like digging into a bed of rock to find yet more rock and stone, without ever encountg a living, breathing creature. I've wanted to believe in something greater for just about ever. unfortunately I've never had any faith or been able to care about rituals or engaging in 'magic' or ceremony if I didn't believe that i was actually doing anything beyond doing a dance for my own amusement. why pretend to cast spells or whatever if I know it's just fake? why go to church and pray to god, for instance, if I don't actually believe that anyone is listening. this is just me and my experiences. that's not exactly what I mean. if i pray to a being. i only care to engage in that action. if i believe the being exists. for me personally, it would feel worthless otherwise. i'm sorry about that  :(. it's just like...for me, i want to engage in ritual and believe that the ritual is actually doing something. if I'm practicing magic and spells Iwant to believe that...they're actually doing something? . I know. that's just an examoke. *example. if I'm engaging in ritual I want to believe that it's actually doing something other than just satisfying my desire for ritual. because on its own, as solely a gesture of self-satisfaction, it will fail for me. nods. I really want to engage in ritual though. personally, for me. if something does not have a tangible, measurable effect it'll feel worthless to me. if i learn linear algebra I will know something more about the world and can apply it to 3D graphics/shaders. if I code, I can create programs. if I pray or cast a spell...i don't even have faith that anything will happen other than that I did the thing. well, sure, i guess. but you know, there are people who have *faith* that it's doing something. that their prayer will have an effect, that their god(s) actually exist. well, I do envy them. that's what this is about. i want something to have faith in. some higher power. at the very least it might make it easier to get through life. i was always envious of people who developed/had a sensation of a personal relationship between them and their god(s). me too. these links may be relevant to you:. >The paucity of scientific evidence is not a justification to believe whatever one wants. i don't like this line and the approach to faith it implies. i'm not particularly interested in...having science be my end-all-be-all. i want to give in to emotion and feeling moreso than just a scientific approach to analyzing something. not in every matter of my life, but in some. huh? i can only interpret things directly literally. sorry. , what do you mean. i think the American left has some pretty good gains too, many of which have been crushed/held back by the huge US imperialist death machine. i tihnk capitalism does a good job of dividing us, though there often is a lot of bickg over particular points. anyway, AliceMarie. i don't WANT to reject metaphysical causes in favour of operating solely within an understanding of science/scientific method/etc. , such as? which ones? and how is this related to the American left? there have been a lot of politically-oriented people and movements though. the Black Panthers, for one. the IWW. shrugs. Are you saying all this as a reaction to me expressing hurt over spiritual stuff? . because it kind of feels like you're a bit in-my-face about this - i might be misinterpreting, but it *sort* of feels like you're bashing spirituality as a reaction to me discussing my feelings about it. well. sort of, but there was more there. i personally have seen no effect or felt no connection to it. others have. and I envy them and the *emotion* and *feeling* of connection and spirit they have. it wasn't actually intended to be a completely literal "spirituality is garbage objectively" statement. okay, well that's just you. you're being kind of aggressive about it and making me feel bad and it's not helping the feelings I'm feeling. i didn't say it was absurd. can you please back off . it's like if someone of religion X said "man I've been feeling pretty distant from my faith lately" and someone else chimed in with "oh religion is just bogus anyway". if i started saying "I've felt pretty distant from my otherkin identity lately/feeling a connection to that and wish I could feel it as strongly as I have in the past" would you say the same things. morn. sorry. i'm sorry . you have nothing to apologize about. nods. bork. <3. heck. surface area. of what. your entire skin. "only against the Terror Beasts of the hideous Flesh World". borks at . yes~. is the most gorgeousest. you are. if you say that. i just can't understand how people justify capitalism. "capitalism is rsponsible for you having cool things!" even if that was true I'd rather have guaranteed access to necessities than the ability to have loads of shiny crapo. well. i'm not sure I give a fuck about western imperialist governments and their actions. only in the context of being against the shit they pull. what? yes, definitely. there is capitalism. and, tbh. capitalism doesn't really mean "free markets". never has. it's always been about the rich and powerful getting richer and more powerful. about using the power of the state to guarantee their power. well. 'regulations'. capitalism relies upon the state to enforce the system. there are no actual free markets :I. well. smaller gov't means. more direct corporate control. well. riot_grrrl, . it goes back to the Marxist idea of exploitation of surplus value. i mean, the capitalists often make stupid decisions, but there are rules/ideas about this kind of thing. to make a profit, capitalists need to extract a worker's surplus value by purchasing the worker's labour for less than its actual value. which allows the capitalist to make a profit and pay the labourer less than the real value of their labour and expended labour-time. like i said. the capitalists often make stupid decisions. or decisions based in bias. and not pure, utterly rational logic. and efficiency. human bias and human evil. yeah, more or les. *less. well, yeah. also. promoting prejudice among the oppressed allows the capitalists to get the proles to do their policing for them. as LBJ said. "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.". this, apparently (to give context) was him explaining the psychology of racism. not so much offg it as a tactic. http://www.snopes.com/lbj-convince-the-lowest-white-man/. but that's irrelevant. the capitalists love to promote infighting among th proles. yeah. any xenophobe or bigot really. bork. that a cat. doing skype/google hangouts. sleeping together via some video chat service. doing mundane tasks while video chatting - like if you're cooking, just have the other person there on the line. ask a bunch of questions about the other person to get to know them . well, a crime in this system. it's a crime against humanity. yeah. my idea of a fun time is reading agricultural reports for various states. and their respective agricultural output for various crops. https://medium.com/guerrilla-feminism/poly-means-polynesian-not-polyamorous-by-lily-stone-2e401e5338f6#.abcx5ndo0. it sounds more like a very unfortunate accidental coolision than co-opting it. well. yes, I'm quite aware of etymology. but it seems that polyamorous people using the word. has become much more visible. than polynesian people. and if polynesian people feel uncomfortable with 'poly' being seen more as a polyamory thing. than a word to describe themselves, I don't think it's my right to really argue it? the author even suggest polya/polyam. as replacements. the author of that article is a polynesian woman btw. well, maybe not deliberately. but i understand the idea of it being uncomfortable that polyamorous people get visibility while polynesian people's word for themselves is not as visible. poly-amorous people receive much more visibility than poly-nesian people. so, i'm fine switching over to polya or polyam or polyamorous. shrugs. i don't really think it's my right to tell a polynesian person that they shouldn't be uncomfortable with the thing? and i think, to a degree, the "we can use the word too" immediate visceral reaction is at least partially rooted in colonial sentiment. idk. if polynesian people don't like poly being used to refer to polyamory i'm fine switching. listen, i get the etymology thing. what exactly is your core issue with the idea. did polyamorous people literally deliberately steal the word from polynesian people? no, i don't think so. does it speak volumes about colonialism that people feel the need to defend their usage of a word over colonized people of color saying it makes them feel uncomfy? i think so. i've seen this sentiment from other polynesian peopel in other articles. why is it utterly ridiculous. i understand etymology, becca. you could make that reductive argument about ANY word and its etymology. and it often does get made to defend oppressive language. not saying you're doing that. but . what, the prefix 'poly'? okay, and how long have polynesian people been using that term? I don't think it was deliberately appropriated. but I think that poly-amorous people receive infinitely more visibility than poly-nesian people. and maybe we can make that better by allowing polynesian people to own that word and feel comfortable? "i'm not changing because <linguistic argument>" certainly does nothing to make colonized people feel like their concerns are being listened to. yeah, really. i believe that person. i believe that they feel that way. and i believe that it is okay for them to feel that way. you could use polya or polyam instead. language is important, is the thing... i mean, that's just my recommendation. may i ask what exactly is the source of your discomfort over this, becca? what was your hangup? how so? nods. that's okay too...being aro is valid and excellent. nods. wushin, but polya/polyam are short too. Cat, can you rephrase that please? because /pol/ :I. no. sorry. i'm just trying to grok it/understand/parse. yeah, exactly. googles khazar. immediately regrets. i'm sorry for talking about/posting/expressing opinions about the polyamory thing. sorry becca. i feel like you were getting upset with me. well whiteness sucks and is a shitty bad construct. and the assimilation into whiteness isn't a good tihng. well yeah. conditional whiteness and such. no that makes sense i guess. idk sorry. pm? unrelated entirely. sure. Cat definitely. idk i could be wrong, i dunno. mantomanto? partner-partner. :P. byt yiu hyst said manto. you said kunamanto. ""kunamanto" suggests "co-partner" which I think is not quite what metamour means?". oh :PP. :(. ugh. they're awful. sigh. uh who is calling shmorky a pedophile. ....why? ... kiwifarms is honestly making me consider deleting all my social stuff. riot_grrrl you're so smol. well. not just sizewise but connotations. smol is mostly cuteness-related. Naomi? is this a real person or a fictional. fictional, from mgs4. heck. Liebknecht, it's a cattail. they're little reedy plants. i wonder if we could just quiet her. ... my housemate's friend she had over said something that irked me... they were talking about some mutual friend of theirs, a cis guy who is apparently very attractive and sexually skilled and I said "I don't really have any interest whatsoever in doing anything with men". and the housemate's friend said "that's what I thought, too, until I met this guy". i feel like that's a very shitty thing to say. (. bork. 0. heck. well, i think there are certain scenarios were a definitive rule and course of action are necessary. well if someone yells a slur in a channel or is a troll. i think a ban is in order, ja? wel. i interpret things very literally. so i need to establish exactly the bounds of what we're talking about. well. now i'm curious if the way we treated elizzza was not being properly respectful of the way she felt. or leah, etc, etc. you were fine. i don't say that as some devil's advocate thing...i genuinely question myself about that kind of stuff all the time. even if we tried gently to talk to her, tell her it didn't make her a bad person, etc, but that she can still *unintentionally* hurt people on accident. nope. didn't matter. i sort of wish I personally hadn't invested nearly as much emotional labour because it was extremely draining. right, so. the only case where i actually think banning someone would be okay is *if* they're being abusive. and i want to make sure that we don't allow ourselves to be abused by someone abusive just so we can keep giving them chances. well, of course. maybe it's wrong of me to have developed a low tolerance for people engaging in abusive or abusive-seeming behaviours. i think some obvious rules make sense. again, like Fox and amy pointed out. some extremely obvious things nake sense. stuff about slurs, etc. it might seem 'obvious' to some people but I don't much enjoy operating on a premise of obviousness. shrugs. i guess. i think that having some guidelines are good. i don't join channels anymore because i don't feel safe anywhere new online. yeah i think we should type something up to make sure people know it's a place where x and y aren't tolerated. that's okay. this is just me offg some opinions/perspective. <. (i say that because i experience that a lot, being disagreed with and immediately feeling like i need to change my mind to agree with the other perosn). okay. ahhh. yeah. is that narcissa wright. you discuss me. you discussss me. Narcissa's Speedy Running Moving Castle. heck. i get frustrated when i ask a question and someone explains a huge amount of things tangential to the thing i asked about. it feels like someone was just duckflapping at me about something I asked about (how do you determine the weights in a neural network) and explained lots of tangential things over and over again. rather than say "I don't know, it's complicated". "I can't give you that answer". dogs are good. is a dog. yes. it rained. bark, yap, sniff, heck. bork. yeah i can't fathom why anyone who isn't a troll would post that shitty video. biological sex doesn't really exist. what did you have to take away? why did you have to take it away? why did you want her password? maybe you should have a little more faith in your child and allow her privacy. what exactly are you afraid of happening? so what exactly are your "feminist mothg" questions. why does her mother restrict her talking to you? yar, no age is too young for a kid to be afforded privacy and independence. what happened? i do believe it. I just said it. why wouldn't you believe that, yar? i'm not talking complete and total independnece. ah. well, i think that teaching kids that they're allowed to have their own boundaries and that their autonomy is important is something good that we should be doing more of. dies because of what? teaching her that she's allowed to have boundaries and privacy? that is abusive. extremely abusive. who is this that is not letting her pee alone? where is it that you live, solskinn? yar, in the future, please don't imply that i don't really believe something I've just expressed to you. if there's confusion about what I believe it can be clarified but i don't like being told what I do and don't think/feel. i generally try to say what i mean and mean what I say. //medium.com/@FarahKarenina/cultural-appropriation-is-a-toxic-concept-97340ff040e9#.8j7ynia98. i linked the article earlier but i wasn't around to talk about it then, or other people weren't. so i'm going to link it again to see if I can open up a discussion because it's still on my mind . //medium.com/@FarahKarenina/cultural-appropriation-is-a-toxic-concept-97340ff040e9#.nshg3nn4u. I'm pretty sure I disagree. that's my take. like obviously it can be and is misapplied but the same thing holds true of...almost any concept, I believe. cultural appropriation is extremely useful in discussing colonialism IMO. I'm trying to find a thing from Tumblr. //.tumblr.com/post/152735141309/borderlinevamp-trungles#notes. ugh. "feminazis"? in what way do "feminazis" act, pray tell? not for feminism, in what way? like, what do they stand for, in your eyes? what do you define as men being oppressed? I'm quite calm. I'm fairly certain that we've heard all these tired arguments before and they don't really faze us much. it's just boring troll 101 stuff. i'm sorry, but we're not interested in what you're selling. i already bought twelve, thanks. i mean. what are the beliefs of these supposed people. that make it harder for feminism to progress. you've not mentioned anyone concrete. right but where. who, name someone. one person. shadow__, can you name me one of these youtubers, please? name me one YouTuber . just one. or link me a video. i mean. subconscious biases are a thing. all white people are, in fact, socialized to be racist, in western society. sorry, it's a fact. it's just like....how Western society is constructed? Milo doesn't use she/her pronouns, iirc. he or they, IIRC. those are Milo's pronouns. ...and? no one said that. the patriarchy we live in does in fact lead to people being socialized with misogyny. shadow__, Milo uses he/him pronouns or they/them. do not use she/her for Milo again. the institutional prejudice in our society that exists against people who are not men. basically our society exists in such a way which disadvantages nonmen systematically. it's the basis of sexism. that's like. not even true at all. the stereotype is that men are smarter actually, mostly. like, men being more competent. show me those statistics. show me something to back that up. i mean, 55% is not 2 to 1. 55 percent to 45 percent. they sampled this in New England. ah, mirroed the national breakdown. still. 1. have you ever been a woman working in a technical field? if not. you really have no right to talk. because women in say, technology, get talked over sooooooo often. women in many fields, really. being forced to go to war? by whom. deemed smart enough by who. yeah. also, that's a problem with capitalism/imperialism, not like, oppression of men. oppression of men based on their gender, specifically. now you're moving the goalposts again. i think you're just a bad 101 troll who's barely better than a shitty MRA markov chain. mansplaining is a thing. where men talk down to nonmen. it happens all the time. amused, because it's not a thing. amused at how wrong you were. thankee-sai. heh. that person should have known. we're strictly an emacs club. crosses arms like a Radical Cool Kid. i mean. i use sublime text if I'm not doing iOS development. it is what it is. we must do what we can in the meantine. white supremacy is Trump's game. America is a nation of many people. bkeys, as the news of the election sets in, people will come to troll feminist groups. we will see a rise in white nationalism. we need to unite. I recommend all of you install Signal. Signal seems very well received. i do worry that they're just a front to get people to put their sensitive communications there. i get paranoid. basically, at any rate, encrypt yr shit. bkeys, do you understand that a win for Trump is a win for white nationalism? The KKK is overjoyed he's president. I do not think most people who voted for him are white nationalists. I didn't say that. this win will only embolden those who are, tohugh. *though. no. listen. Listen to us. They are becoming vastly emboldened. This is undeniable. This is a serious issue. That cannot be ignored. Hate crimes will increase. Bigotry will increase. Look at all the ones who are, though. It's not about "all trump supporters". it's "the scariest among them". We cannot ignore that. that's not the issue here. That's not what I am talking about. I am talking about the ones who are literal neonazis. Who see Trump as their man. You're not listening to me. In the wake of Brexit, hate crimes increased massively. The same WILL happen here. And we must be ready for it. bkeys, you're just not listening. i'm sorry. the KKK is overjoyed that Trump is President. I would suggest a moratorium on new users for the time being. Shut this channel down. +i only. There will be a lot of trolls coming in, lots of hateful people. My main objection would be that yes the KKK is happy about him being president; but in a world that Clinton won the bankers would of been happy. what abut the bankers? which bankers. The ones who donated to her campaign. trans people, gay people, people of color, disabled people. WILL suffer under Trump in a huge way. I think we should probably set this +I. this channel. lock everything down. I'm so scared all the time lately. I positively cannot believe the people who think that Trump is "keeping LGBT people safe from the radical Islamic terroristS". and not, you know, considg the idea that the biggest threat is from people in the united states? that's the idea. except we might not get the same pinkwashing as Israel. in fact, probably won't. yikes. I can't believe how many Trump supporters fell for the paper tiger of "radical islam" being a threat to people in the United States. "Trump supports gays because he promises to keep you safe from terrorists!" but what about keeping people safe from people in this country who hate queer people....? it's creating a largely imaginary threat. it's a reaction to a largely imaginary threat. now, don't get me wrong, ISIS isn't like, fake. and terror does happen but it's pretty clear that Western intervention in the affairs of other places are largely responsible for so much awful shit. exactly!!!! exactly... it's hilarious (read: scary). Trump supporters are like "we want good jobs, our jobs are shit, we want better lives". not understanding...that capitalism is pretty much the root of all the problems that cause these things. what I wanna know now. is it possible to convince Trump supporters of what they've done? is it even possible, yar. to get these people to understand why we're afraid. why we have valid reasons to be afraid. they think we all love Clinton but that's so laughable. they don't understand that the people who hate queer people are only going to get emboldened. or they refuse to even accept the idea that this might be the case. why have they refused to accept this idea? can we dissuade them from it? I sure wish I had the Point-Of-View gun from the HGTTG movie right now... well, the pov gun literally makes you see it in their perspective in your mind and makes you feel what they feel. which a person on the web can jsut refuse to do. no, not to understand them. I do understand them, to a degree. and feel somewhat guilty that I didn't do...more to provide another alternative outlet to Trump supporter's emotions? like maybe I could have done more. instead of being angry. i dunno... i know that there's probably a lot of other leftists out there who blame themselves. or feel guilty. was it my fault? did i fail humanity . by not being there for more emotional labour. to try and give a different opinion. or lacks tyhe spoons. is tired and exhausted. i tihnk we all need to start listening to RMS more. Richard Stallman. though maybe not. given how awful he is about some things. support the queer people in your life. the gay, trans (Binary and nonbinary), bi, lesbian, pansexualy, polysexual people in your life. support the people of color in your life. support the disabled people in your life. support the muslims in your life. tell them you love them. show them you love them. let them know that they are not alone. support the undocumented immigrants in your life. Who's ESR? RMS is richard Stallman. Richard Stallman has some gross positions like "distributing child porn should be allowed because we shouldn't restrict free information". y'know, the child rapists are bad!!! but the content they produced should be free. i am growing vastly more skeptical of the notion that separatism - ie, women separatism from men - is actually going to be a good idea in our fight against fascism and capitalism. i was talking with an anarchist earlier who refuses to work with any men, or any nonmen who work with men. well, i mean. "work with" in the sense of politics. antifa, etc. i don't think they meant it in terms of labour. hmm...i suppose it can be in certain contexts. like trans-only spaces are good. but by separatism i'm talking more...people who try to separate entirely. well...actually what I'm talking about is white women engaging in separatism from men. which is often racist in its nature. maybe we're not conceptualizing separatism the same way. like, something i encounter on Facebook a lot. there's a subgroup of (overwhelmingly white) trans women who are vehement against CAFAB people. and act like they're the worst people ever and AFAB are so gross and icky. i'm not saying wanting to be distant from, say, men is a bad thing or being wary thereof but it's necessary to analyze things. idk, sorry. "women working with men in rojava are just working towards restoring their masculinity". or "men are inherently violent". i think there's a lot of assumptions we've made, or have been fed, or ideas of humans that have been manufactured, as a result of white supremacy and capitalism. idk. i think most pro-Trump people are going to dismiss any white supremacist acts that occur in the near future as a plot against them. as staged, as fake. oh, absolutely. he wanted to get into the seat. and be in power. and that's pretty much all I think he cared about. I agree with that. but now we need to be careful. we need to be cautious and vigilant. yeah. we cannot guarantee that it won't happen. and we have to be prepared for the possibility that it will. we have to be prepared for MANY possibilities. in the meantime it's a harm-reduction tactic and taking *away* marriage rights isn't any good. in an ideal society there wouldn't be a need for marriage and such. i think if a boat is sinking. it's going to be a clusterfuck no matter what. save as many as you can? . yeah. yeah, defending capitalism. being classist. if you're well-off, not thinking of the implications talking about certain things can have on people who do not have class privilege. I have an awful confession to make. what is it? Anarchocommunism is the ideal for society, yes - but I'm starting to think Maoism is how we get there. The mass line and protracted people's war. basically, you listen to the individual and specific concerns of people in areas, and enhance them with communist theory, and make propositions/action plans that will echo and amplify the concerns of people in those areas and address them. basically, it makes it so that you're not just telling people what to do. you're listening to them and making what *they* want and need work within a communist framework. so that they'll feel more or less like the solutions came from their communities rather than being handed to them by people who might not understand the struggles and concerns of people in those areas. does that make sense? In what you are describing there you are talking about one group who is 'saying what they need' and another group that is 'listening'. What determines which group you are in? nuit, what about the mass line? also, em, basically, if you're in a specific neighborhood in a city, you listen to what the problems are that affect them right there, right then. and figure out how to address those problems in a way that feels useful and organic to them. i'm not exactly sure what stageism is. I wouldn't exactly call myself a maoist really, but I think there are great ideas that can be used . at any rate, I think that people of all anticapitalist variety need to come together now. https://pics.onsizzle.com/h-dont-panic-radicalize-6320400.png. i mean, it's not necessarily? but our feminism is radical, leftist feminism, intersectional. I saw an awesome thing a while back that was kinda funny. "Socialism without feminism is brocialism. Feminism without socialism is Hillary Clinton.". Basically, we need to understand that all of our liberation is NOT just a matter of destroying the patriarchy. We also need to realize that class is such an integral part of this, we need to understand the intersection of class, race, gender, disability, etc. we need to understand that disability is a social construct related to one's ability to produce surplus value for capitalism. yeah...i dunno. i mean like, i dunno how best to defend against the capitalists who might seek to destroy the work of the anti-capitalists. em, i said earlier. it's not necessarily. but there are many many marxist feminists. it's not INHERENTLY a part of feminism. because THIS individual IRC channel is a leftist one. not all feminist spaces are marxist. no, it's okay. under communism will there be restaurants? yeah, but it won't be all about profit. there will still be people who want to cook and share it with others. there will be a lot more like, communal kitchens and stuff. this is an intersectional feminist space. well, i mean, economics/class is certainly a part of thing. what do you mean by an "economic view", though. yeah, like...societal stuff is really important. institutional . institutional things form the basis for a lot of the oppression that exists in this world. and while individual isolated acts aren't unimportant, they don't describe why the world is the way it is. no, i believe there are some men. em, I've mentioned multiple times. communism and feminism are not inherently linked. THIS channel is of the communist/leftist variety. but feminism is not inherently so. yeah. and understanding of class issues/the evil of capitalism is kinda necessary for good feminism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy. maybe because there are people with Dr in their handle? I do not have a PhD, it's just a nickname. I believe drastik is an altered form of the word "drastic". http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drastic. yeah. I don't know if anyone here does. maybe someone does, but I wouldn't know of it. nods. not for profit. there will still be people who want to cook for others and share their culinary art with others. there will be people who come together to cook because they enjoy it. and it will serve the benefit of feeding people, not making people wealthy. i mean, ideally. in practice, maybe. but the idea of working for profit isn't going to be a thing. labour will be self-directed. labour will exist as a means of creating things with use value. people grow food because people need food. people make clothes because they need clothes. absolutely. probably. i mean, computers are a very very *useful* technology. that have revolutionized how things get produced. truth be told, an enormous amount of labour nowadays can be entirely automated. i mean, it's not like we can just transition instantly to Fully Automated Luxury Communism for everyone right away. I mean, I wish we could FALC for everyone. that's a good question. i mean, people today have a relative choice of what they get into. i think we need to eliminate the idea that everyone *needs* to work. there will still be people who want to work. i'm not 100% sure. i mean, capitalism/white supremacy have SO much to do with modern patriarchy. FALC = fully automated luxury communism . here, read this, with regards to questions like "who would do the hard labour". https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/21u7jo/how_can_people_be_expected_to_work_hard_if_they/. https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101. no no no no no no no. never eugenics. malehood/masculinity aren't inherently toxic, imo. the patriarchy is. the patriarchy demands men perform toxic gender roles. yes they are. they are intrinsically flawed modalities. i mean, patriarchal ideals of masculinity are. but I believe firmly that non-patriarchal ideals of manhood and masculinity exist. hell, I have certain masculine traits, as a woman. i think patriarchy-defined masculinity is very toxic. i mean, the gender binary itself is toxic. and we have to remember. that it's Western white supremacy and capitalism that are the sources of the gender binary. many non-Western societies have radically different ideals on gender. eugenics is ALWAYS bad. always. because it ALWAYS disproportionately harms disabled people. queer people. intersex people. etc. yes, VERY racist. well, let me back up for a minute. women don't give birth to men. I mean, yes, kinda, but. people give birth to infants that are then *assigned male at birth*. some of them grow up to identify with/feel comfortable with what they were assigned at birth. and then there are those who do not. i think we need to eliminate assignment of gender at birth. i don't think Western binaristic notions of womanhood are the answer either. or making that the dominant force in society. i think we need to truly, seriously understand the root of all this. which is, Western white supremacist gender binary notions. I'd recommend, em, taking a look at notions of gender outside of Western societies. to understand that the man/woman binary is not something that exists universally, necessarily. em, are you listening to me? so, what I'm saying is. that we need to eliminate patriarchal ideals of masculinity. and the way we assign gender. which addresses the root of the problem, not JUST "protect yourself from men". if we eliminate the /patriarchy/, there won't be anything forcing these toxic masculine *gender roles* on people or coercing them into a toxic performance of gender. all gender, ultimately, is performative. in my opinion. men are not inherently violent, in my view. yes! absolutely. also, remember, em. not every person with a vagina is a woman. and not every person with a penis, is a man. and not everyone can be classified as either a man or a woman. there are people who exist outside of the gender binary. yeah. I think D&D would flourish under communism >_>. all kinds of paper-and-pen roleplaying games, really. I mean, I think it would especially flourish. ywa. yeah. entertainment revolving more around ingenuity and creativity. rather than "buy this to have fun" would probably be much stronger. oh, it's a good thing. I just use >_> a lot as like.... the emotional context implied by the `>_>` emoji, for me, is more...i dunno, hard to explain. but i didn't mean it negatiely. eugenics is never the answer. it will only lead to killing disabled people. queer people. it leads to racial 'purity'. basically, the whole IDEA of genetic 'purity' or being able to create purity through controlling genetics. is disgusting. em, step 1 isn't "change everyone's heart's/minds" though. there's a lot of initial steps. you'd kill trans woman. *women. and lots of intersex people. we here in this channel do NOT. at ALL . support biological essentialist ideals. such as XX = woman, XY = man. the biological sex binary is as much a myth as the gender binary. and is not productive. at all. we don't hate men here or reduce the problem to "men are bad". the source of all ill in this world is NOT men. we don't support such reductive notions. yep. it's very reductive and doesn't get at the root of the problem. yep. the patriarchy WANTS people to think men are violent. it's self-justification. the patriarchy socializes men to be violent. impresses these roles upon them. coerces them into behaving in this way. it is not some inherent characteristic to men. em, are you listening? yeah, exactly. yeah, but they might still be listening. you stand correct. Drastik is indeed drastic with a k instead of a c (i hope you can see this). i can. i did not, no. I just am able to see your message. you could probably do publicly? what are your rules-related problems. nothing specific i don't think, but the trump election didn't help. mcpro, what do you mean. any hypotheses on what the patriarchy did specifically? sent in from the patriarchy? in what way. like, from where specifically? many of the trolls who come here are quite clever/intelligent. it's their bias and misogyny that's the problem. it's a societal structure. more like an abstract that exists in society. as opposed to one clear definite institution. is there something inherently wrong about being on the left? "virtue signaling" seems mostly like an alt-right terminology to decry people with specific values. "oh you're just posturing to impress your SJW cuck friends". kind of thing. alt-right is white nationalists and neonazis. mostly. why would you be interested in an alt-right channel. like, its really useful to understand why people see the world otherwise than you. I understand WHY they see the world otherwise, to a degree. but too much emphasis on "understanding" people like that is dangerous. it's better to defend against nazis than try to understand them. they don't care about/want your understanding. they want you, your disabled comrades, your black comrades, dead. they want your queer comrades dead. "I want to ensure a safe society for everyone where there is no bigotry". yeah wow such an awful thing to be >_>. honesty would be really nice. I'm really uninterested in understanding nazis. i mean like, maybe convincing proto-nazis away from going full-on? if i see someone heading down that road, yeah. how are you going to convice them that are wrong then? i dunno. none of us want you here, sorry. we don't want nazi sympathizers in here sorry. when did I say that I was a nazi sympathizer ? you didn't. we just wanna make sure people aren't. we get a lot of trolls. people come in here and brigade all the time. and harass. sigh. the Unicode value representing the hammer and sickle is U+262D, just sayin'. liberation would be tearing down the fence altogether. well, i mean. not everyone wants to play baseball. but i get what you mean. yar, sorry. oh. i don't pick up on tone well. yar, statements of the form "ok fine do whatever you want" are often used, in spoken speech, to indicate exasperation/passive-aggression. not saying you did that. or meant it that way, but it can be interpreted that way. so I thought I annoyed you . or for example, public places assume everyone can walk unassisted/without a cane or wheelchair. yep. yeah. government violations? such as...? IMP_42, i don't think so. oh, government violations in terms of like, not providing accessibility. well...sadly a law can exist but no one can give a heck about it. and it just doesn't get enforced. so so so so so many ADA violations and no one even cares. i mean, these are all examples of things that happen. i wasn't talking about anything specific I personally have experienced. the NYC subway system has so few elevators. no one cares, really. to fix it. buildings without wheelchair access. politicians don't really care, sadly. look at the UK. i'm saying even if they do. look at the UK and people having disability benefits slashed. what is the due diligence of civic duties? it sucks. disabled people are so heavily disadvantaged in this world. what. ...what? what does that have to do with anything. the sociobiology thing. i mean. even if there is willingness and action. sometimes you get steamrolled over, ignored, hell even jailed. jail is not an excuse? wut. it's not an excuse for what. yeah. band-aid . doesn't address root cause. could be useful as a harm-reduction tool? but idk. what's it about. nods. can i complain about a technology. why is addrlen a parameter to the bind() function if you could theoretically just get the my_addr->ai_addrlen from the sockaddr you pass into the function. what do you mean. whoever wrote the bind() function could just dereference the address length from the pointer to the sockaddr that got passed in. and I'm pretty sure that you can pass in either a sockaddr_in or sockaddr_in6 to bind() as the my_addr param. i think you can just cast between them easily. at least, that's how I see it? i could be thinking about it wrong. I dunno how bind() is implemented. i mean, though. there are people who don't identify as human, genuinely. and i think that's valid. it's generally very easy to know when someone is trolling. yeah. kinda cautious about who. me? or IMP_42. oh, right. yeah... 11-dimensional gender space. extra dimensions folded at the quantum level. err, extra genders folded at the quantum level. I had a lamb gyro a few hours ago. should I eat more. creepy. very creepy. she told you that you were worthless? that's abuse. that's abuse. yeah. it's not always an absolute. but the likelihood of experience/status imbalance makes it...a tentative thing. abuse can happen to anyone. and come from anyone. regardless of gender. sorry. it happens. busy people. well, there's trolls all the time, really. has something happened? we don't know what specifically you are experiencing. could you tell us more? trouble in what way? as in, you faced discrimination/bigotry? yeah...being trans is hard. well, first let. first let's ask. what do you think about people with Down's syndrome? and? what do you think about their right to exist. their rights in general. do you think their disability means they shouldn't have a right to exist? ah, okay. so what would the advantage of aborting a fetus with a detectable disability be? what do you think might cause a person to not want a disabled child? what do you think might cause it to be more than they can handle? vaesper, because I'm trying to get at something. and trying out the socratic method rather than just talking at you. i personally think it's *very* relevant to examine what might cause a disability to be more than potential parents can handle. in fact, I think the prime reason is that society is not very friendly to disabled people. and does not like to provide the necessary accommodations. also, disabled people are seen as lesser. now, this isn't to say, abrogate the rights of someone seeking an abortion. but it's good to examine what might cause someone to not want a disabled child, imo. i think that rather than simply say whether or not a person should be allowed to seek such an abortion. we should examine why and whether or not those societal attitudes need changing. what would your opinion be of a white person who wanted an abortion because their child would be black? to prevent them from being born with Down's syndrome? i don't see the value in eliminating people with Down's syndrome. what if we changed our societal attitudes and did not see them as lesser, or burdens? well then, why not work towards that? i think that's a much better solution than "eliminate disabled people from the population". i think so, yeah. nothing is inevitable. i mean, that's why it's a thing to be worked towards. work towards it to bring it closer. i think eliminating people with Down's syndrome from the population is about as useful (by which I mean, not useful at all) and equally as horrific as trying to eliminate any attribute. like genetically modifying people not to be black. i think it would be wrong to genetically modify children, especially in current society. eugenics is a hell of an awful thing. .... the metric sucks. ...what? i suppose. strive for progress? define "progress". what sort of progress? progress of what nature? well. I don't think that's an inherent tendency of human society. i think that's something that exists due to capitalism. do you have any evidence this is something inherent to humanity? i don't think I have the energy for this convo, sorry. define endowment bias. capitalism as we understand it today, also, is only really an invention of the past...oh, 300-ish years? . i mean, 'meritocracy' in its current form/the idea of it has a lot of problems. especially since the idea of the "most fit" person for a position has little to do with their performance. and if it does, it ignores the idea of societal factors that might disable a person. "from each according to their ability, to each according to their need" is a pretty good system. I mean, I think production should be self-managed and for individual use. rather than for creating surplus value for, say, capitalists. you work/produce things of value, not things for profit. i mean, surplus things of value, sure. enough grain to last the winter, extra tools in case you need them. but that's different than what I'm talking about. wolves kill sheep to eat them. because wolves need meat to survive. they do? do you have like. sources on wolf behavior . on some notion of just a mad, uncontrolled killing frenzy? because that doesn't sound like how most predators act. can you provide any evidence that wolves behave this way. no, I can't, because I was unaware canids behaved this way. I mean, I think humans are extremely biased against wolves. given that wolves impact herds/profit/etc. such that humans have driven wolves to the brink of extinction. other predators, too. i mean, we have to first establish whether or not that behaviour exists in wolves. there's a LOT of stereotypes/misinformation about wolves out there. so if your analogy isn't even true in the natural world. then it's not very applicable to humans. //www.outsideonline.com/2066881/truth-about-wolf-surplus-killing-survival-not-sport. most of the articles I'm seeing on this show that wolves kill large numbers as a means of surplus. literally surplus food. not sport or "not knowing what to do with the prey" but literally as a means of having extra food for a winter. You've yet to prove that this is even a real thing wolves do. okay. well, rather than some rando's opinion on canid behaviour, maybe we can find some expert analysis on this. Also this article made me laugh with one of the lines. //missoulian.com/news/local/wolves-kill-sheep-at-ranch-near-dillon/article_5ff01772-938f-11de-9aca-001cc4c03286.html ""My bucks were on private ground, in a pasture where we've been pasturing them for 50 years. The wolves were intruders that were in the wrong place," he said.". >wolves. >intruders. also, just because certain canids do it, doesn't mean necessarily it's applicable to humans. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_killing. okay, so it appears to be a thing. i really don't think that it's necessarily accurate to apply the concept to humans. I didn't say you were. I don't think you are. I just don't see the point of this . i mean, yes, humans have cognitive bias. oh, is this a big analogy for "cognitive bias might once have served a purpose in the past" rather than necessarily about surplus killing itself? what is your point. can you condense it into one, easy sentence please. to which society? human society? I don't think so, given that capitalism is EXTREMELY Western in nature. yes, Russia/China were socialist states. what of it? what's your point. well, why do you think it failed miserably? do you think maybe that extreme Western/capitalist opposition to it might have been a thing. and years of capitalists spreading propaganda. and doing whatever possible to stop workers from exercising their rights. and prevent the system? because honestly. I think that might be a big pat. *part. communism cannot be seen to have failed entirely under its own weight. it was, in large part, killed. i don't think 'biological programming', also, is necessarily somehow all that powerful. i mean, maybe not as powerful as you think, is what I'm saying. i mean, it's possible. but i don't think it's as important as doing the right thing. IMP_42, what's your area of expertise/line of work. I'm just saying that I don't think even many neuroscientists are all that convinced on how the brain/biology/mind etc work. so i think to a degree, it's not useful to spend too much time philosophizing about. and to instead just figure out what actually should be *done*. it depends on what "human nature" is. and i think the idea of 'human nature', some inherent thing. is largely silly. people have claimed that almost everything under the sun is 'human nature'. and humans act in so many distinct and different ways. it. it's human nature for men to rape women, for instance. i mean, i'm not claiming that it IS human nature. just, that people *claim* that it is. are you talking about a specific bias or a generic concept of a bias. also, do you like, see any value in actually *advocating* for any useful social changes? or is it all lofty and theoretical for you. well, i mean. do you actually believe in any specific social changes? or is it all a matter of "forming an opinion" to you? like, what's your opinion on Nazis. i mean, to me, there's a certain point where forming an opinion is less important that, say. advocating for the rights and lives of fellow people. i mean, your opinion on like, dealing with them. is it all just theory and opinions? because white nationalists want to literally kill people of color and muslims. and i don't really care about the theory behind them. and instead would like to stop them. do you think that murdg Jews simply for being Jewish is wrong? i didn't say killing people was always bad. i'm talking about people who want to murder black people and Muslims simply for who they are. would you stop that, if you could? would you stop a neo-nazi from killing a gay person out of hatred? yes or no. if you could. is that sarcasm? oh, okay. i don't detect sarcasm very well and get a lot of 'false positives'. why is that such a hard question? if you could prevent neo-nazis from massacring a bunch of Jewish people, would you? see, because, i'm a big believer in enacting real solutions rather than discussing the theory of things. there need to be immediate responses to problems like this. i think that understanding them is the lesser of priorities. building defenses comes first. no. why? i mean, the problem is that to a degree I DO understand it. which is? like, not giving scholarships to anyone who's black? why would you not give assistance to people who are at a social disadvantage? huh? who is using skin color as an arbitrary way to define minority. i think elky is using 'minority' in a generic sense. to mean 'marginalized minority' in the sense of a literal minority. as in, transgender people make up 1%ish of the population. a literal minority. in the united states, black people really are largely economically disadvantaged. i mean, they definitely are. i mean, the idea isn't to focus on one thing, the idea is to recognize the intersection of race and class. it's not like fighting racism means we don't also fight classism. and predation on the working people by the capitalists. rescind means "to take back". elky, I'm not sure if they do. i'm hesitant to assume what people do/do not know. I mean, ethnic conflict within Africa occurs. like, the Rwandan genocide. yeah. what was the last you saw. The last I saw was "elky dies laughing". prepare for the worst, is my advice. regardless of what happens, have a plan. have a plan that takes the worst outcome into account as a possibility. I'd say, prepare for drastic. even if it doesn't happen. you'll be better prepared. are you listening to me? my advice is "prepare for the worst even if it doesn't come to pass". there's NO harm in being prepared. what would you do if he DID screw up the H1B system? do you have a plan in place? it's making up for lost time. it's helping to bring a disadvantaged population to the same level. i mean, it's not like scholarships for merit don't already exist. or financial aid for those who need it. it's not "only give financial assistance to black people going to college", which the alt-right would have you believe. literally the alt-right would try to convince you that white people are oppressed and that Jews and black people rule the country with an iron fist of feminism and political correctness. and will engage in rampant miscegenation and sully their white women, while at the same time decrying people of color for being lazy and all on welfare. none of that is true, of course. that's basically literally what's happening in the US, IMP_42. white people built an empire in this country via the labour of people of color, literal slaves, and then spent decades trying to keep them down. and still do. IMP_42, no one is saying "only provide justice to black people". or "only black people should be helped from a position of economic disadvantage" but it's important to realize what's actually going on in society. it's crucial to understanding the actual reality of things. racism exists. it is indeed because people of color face more bullshit. black people suffer from hundreds of years of slavery and then many more decades spent trying to literally keep them down. and oppressed. deny their voting rights, enforce segregation. stereotype them as criminals and thugs. assassinate political leaders fighting for justice. this has been going on for so many years. i'd say black people suffer from white supremacy. plain and simple. i can't hear what IMP_42 is saying. is it some white nonsense. i mean. did u even read the rules. this sorta thing happens. i mean, just because someone said "yeah you can talk about intersectional stuff" doesn't mean it's carte blanche to talk about /whatever/. obviously there's. nuance and situational stuff. if I said "hey can I talk about historical figures" and someone said "yes", it would be abusing that to talk at great length and in morbid detail about famous serial killers/child abusers. what the heck is up with this "virtue signaling" altright doublethink. hey so remember when black americans built their own institutions and businesses and strong communities and kept police brutality out and the US government waged war on them because of that. fucking remember that. what are you femopsing? to be clear, that's not me agreeing with it, that was me being bitter at the brutality of the US government and how shite it is and how racist this shithole of a country is. /. don't forget the US concerned citizens and common folk who were involved. hackunoichi, "!femops" is a command to summon the operators of this channel. it's basically like calling "moderators! come quick, something that requires your attention is occurring". ah ok ! ). in the US, not as much. depends on the insurance. usually. sometimes not. yeah, no. hah. insurance costs out of pocket can be upwards of $300 a month. and if you make over a certain amount of money and don't have insurance. you get fined. and companies are not obligated to provide insurance to their workers. if you're poor enough you can get free health insurance but the fascists are gonna blow that up. vaesper, it's not about euphemisms. "sex worker" is much more literal and direct. "prostitute" has a lot of aggressive connotations. and a lot of demeaning connotations. it's not a dirty word. it's a descriptor of like, a literal type of sex work. terminology. every sex worker I've ever spoken to. //www.thenation.com/article/lets-call-sex-work-what-it-work/. "prostitution" has such connotations of like...implying sex workers are all these poor abused souls who are trapped in some kind of hell who need to be rescued. like they're all trafficking victims and such. trying to convince yourself in what capacity? I don't understand the relevance. did you even read it? i mean. sex work is work. no matter what, and we're not swerfy here. //www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/thinking-of-sex-work-as-work/283843/. i mean, what do you mean by that, though? in what way do we take the cultural context of the us as the go-to standard. other than me linking to a website whose url I didn't even pay attention to tbh. literally every sex worker I've ever known prefers this terminology. and what we're saying. vaesper, what's your dog in this fight. that's an expression that means "why are you pressing this issue". is it just discomfort with being asked not to use the word "prostitute"? under attack in what way? you were asked not to use a specific terminology and then fought it. why? louiz? vaesper, she's an op. vaesper, you were asked not to use a term and provided an explanation. vaesper, that's why. we provided you the info. by swallowing your damn pride. it's a fucking internet chatroom. distract yrself. sometimes you'll end up feeling uncomfortable in the course of learning stuff. . sorry. feeling uncomfortable is a necessary part of learning, sometimes. I'm sorry if I'm on edge, just, you know, fascists controlling the damn white house and whatnot. so I'm prone to be snippy. well, i mean, work is currently necessary to procure the resources necessary to survive, hackunoichi. would you say that about other slurs, too? if you can't accept the idea of it, is the thing. In french, work is a creation of money and capitalism. To produce is not to work. I don’t know in English. well, i mean, labour existed before capitalism. but i see what you mean, sorta. yeah. there is a difference between "work" and "labour", i think. i don't mind performing some useful or pleasurable labour. yreah. i'm agreeing with you, hackunoichi. all work is exploitative. i don't think that's at all what she was saying. yeah, this isn't just us-centric. sex work is work no matter where it is being performed, and the notion of "prostitution" and the language around it. is used to demean sex workers. and portray it in a certain light. well, see. Trump basically just lies and does whatever he wants for power. he's a fascist. it's productive to the aim of drumming up populist support. they don't actually care about "being productive". or justice or working together. Trump just wants to be the man in the high castle. welcome to the cyberpunk dystopia. yr basically a character in a shadowrun game at this point. kristina, it's because there's no need/reason for Trump to actually be honest. his entire campaign was built on lies. yep. it's part of the america first thing. it's gross. it's nationalism and xenophobia. xenophobia is gross. kristina, because he's a fascist. I'm growing even more disillusioned by liberals than I thought possible. I thought I was at Total Disillusionment™. what happened? Oh, the whole "building defenses against fascism/denying fascists their freedom of speech makes you just as bad". how to deal with it? just action for what we believe in i suppose. I dunno. some liberals might be convinced. some can be swung over. but i think it's less important to spend time convincing and more important to build defenses. ah the classic anti-antifa rhetoric. yeah, anti-antifa. antifa = antifascism. anti-antifa = liberals who get uncomfortable with direct action against fascism because they're uncomfortable with challenges to the status quo. and think that beating up nazis is mean. remember that it is a sacred responsibility to beat up any fascists or nazis you see. it's just kyriarchy again. welcome to white supremacist america. I propose that we bring back the black panthers. I think black militant communists ready to fuck up nazis are exactly what this society needs. there's a church near my apartment with a sign that says "Trump is a rapist, racist con man". sigh. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-Point_Program. i think i have a few right angles, so no. i'm not a round. (that's a play on words). yeah, cis feminism often sucks. lots of places. TERF spaces. any feminists who don't think transgender women are women. there are many different types of modern day feminism. hm? talking bathrooms. also oh boy thank you Amtrak Wifi for dropping literally all of my packets now and forever. what about washrooms? i don't really have a choice, Defcronyke. not my network. what do you mean. like, this is literally not an internet connection I personally am paying for. I'm not at my house. so I have no control over i. it. rooted in what sense? what exactly is the problem. i don't love Time Warner, don't get me wrong. why? also, even at my apartment back home, Time Warner is pretty much the only option. sad to say. follow who/pm who? is that what 'we' is referring to in that context? ah. yeah, NYC doesn't have an enormous amount of internet options sadly. i mean, I don't really have the option of doing that right now? i am fully aware. I've lived there for years. careful of what specifically? yeah. i'll be fine, relatively. I'm a software developer. the culture of it kind of sucks, tbh. but i like what I do, i like technology. i just don't care for startup culture, tech culture, etc. i like technology and learning and innovating and growing but I could not care less about venture capitalists and any of that bullshit. i code because computers are fascinating; the money/job aspect just allows me to feed myself, basically. and enjoy a relatively comfortable life. oyakodon is yummy. first time making it and it came out pretty well. why in the heck is there so much fearmongg about nuclear power. why the heck do white people act like they deserve brownie points for stopping doing things that were awful that were going on. context? oh just reminiscing on people I've seen like. acting like it's a credit towards white people for ending slavery in the US. or for giving rights that people should have had in the first place. what exactly causes a person to believe that Islam is some extremist violent hateful ideology. sigh. lack of critical thinking about what? mmm. sigh. i'm terrified of queer people in the US being sent to death camps. probably won't happen - probably will just be, remove all your protections and such - but I fear it nonetheless. no, i meant just all queer people in the US. i dunno if it's a rational fear. I get lots of irrational paranoias. i mean, I know. but I'm afraid that it's inevitable. that it's what'll happen. why much less so? i envy you. Defcronyke can i ask you a question. //www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/23/291525991/when-vanilla-was-brown-and-how-we-came-to-see-it-as-white. fascinating stuff. "the end of Nazis not feeling validated in their white supremacy and the beginning of them thinking that they can do whatever they want and fuck whoever doesn't like it". the "alt-right" are just white supremacists. that's all they are. fucking Nazis. wut. "actually, communists caused nazis". ohhh of course. I was just about to ask. "i hope you're not perpetuating that goddang Nazi holodomor myth". was there a famine? yeah, weather happens, Stalin can't scream at the clouds to make them do his bidding. you also have to consider that many kulaks burned their fields rather than submit to collectivization, because of course the wealthy landowners are gonna be salty. was there bureaucracy and mismanagement? yeah, in any system there is. i don't think Stalin was good but I think we need to take some of the more outlandish Western imperialist propaganda about communist states in stride . well, no, true, but the point stands. refutation of what? fascism is one of the two ideologies of capitalism. the other being liberalism. capitalism itself gives rise to fascism. liberal capitalist society produces the social climate for fascism to rise. because liberal capitalist societies are fucked, yo. but it's important to understand that liberalism and fascism are two sides of the same coin. no, classical liberalism. in the leftist sense. not "democrats" vs "republicans" or any silly such thing. free market capitalism, economic "freedom". yeah, it's gross stuff . neoliberalism is choking this planet and its people. and creating the conditions necessary for fascism to rise. howso? what's yr local political system? mmm. find out who yr local leftists are. most Finns speak English, I thought? . idk, Finnish craigslist. P. Well, i mean, find the actual people themselves. talk to them. i think kirjatoukka is also a Finn. oh. jesus Christ. jeff sessions made a speech back in 2000 fearmongg about how special ed students were basically getting away with everything and not being punished. how disabled kids are basically raping and assaulting people and nothing is being done because of accommodations. it's like do these people even care about sounding remotely accurate with how the world works. //www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/floor-statements?ID=a7977b1d-7e9c-9af9-753e-8f3a8b3b43fb. what exactly do you think we will be able to do to alleviate yr boredom. do you know what this channel is for and why. Defcronyke? also hi again. what do you mean "too meta". also can i ask a weird question. i was talking to Defcronyke. I was asking them if i could ask THEM a weird question. what do you mean by that, jccss-jeremy? "jccss-jeremy" is the realname when i look at it. i do not see what you are seeing, yar. oh wait is jccss-jeremy also Defcronkyke? . Defcronyke. someone please tell me in literal terms what is going on. because I am confused. And not getting it and telling me "look at X" is not going to help me understand the implications. yar, elky, please elaborate? freenode doesn't really mandate what we have to talk about here. to the best of my knowledge. why would we have to stay off topic? we can talk about feminism here if we want. and we do all the time. there are no rules about this dictating things that we follow. we've never even heard of any of these 'rules'. no, it's just a temperature system. widely used . Defcronyke do you know what plurality is. it's definitely real. required to achieve fairness? how was it fucking with y'all. why weren't things fair. plurality is hard. is what yar said correct, Defcronyke. may i ask why? huh? disparity howso. 'superficial versions'? well, you can accuse someone of being -ist and that doesn't necessarily make it true. hm? i'm not following. ah. for all of society. it's kind of inescapable. society itself is racist. //www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5fx6hw/born_rich_2003_jamie_johnson_johnson_johnson/. that's sarcasm. I want to make a hat that says "Make Syracuse Haudenosaunee Again". Syracuse is a city in Upstate NY and was inhabited pre-Europeans by the Onondaga nation. the Onondaga were a constituent of the Haudenosaunee, known to Europeans as the "Iroquois". A confederacy of several nations. basically as a pushback against this white supremacist nation we live in. mmm, I wonder if I could do that for like Cafepress or something. donate all funds to Standing Rock. huh? what do you mean. when I said "basically as a pushback against this white supremacist nation we live in" I meant "I have the desire to make this hat because I want to pushback against this white supremacist nation, the United States of America". not "the Haudenosaunee were formed as a pushback against a white supremacist nation". where are you from. ah. cool, I live in NYC too. Harlem. /. oh nice. is where i'm from. yeah, Green Lake is a meromictic lake. which means that there's no seasonal intermingling . the layers of water between the surface and deep do not mix. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meromictic_lake. it's a very deep lake for its surface area. it's beautiful but going there always freaked me out because of the basically vertical drop-off in some areas, just a few feet from the shore. i have a very bad fear of deep water. green lake reaches a maximum depth of 195 feet. Seneca Lake is deeper though, 618 feet. i hate liberals. let's hope you're also talking about "liberals" in the leftist sense. not the "liberal/conservative" dichotomy that is itself a liberal dichotomy. guh. liberals. ). 260 seconds). hi. i dreamt last night that all or part of the united states (dunno whihc, it was a dream) became a socialist state. howdy Roxie. welcome . not all of us are ladies here. shrugs. just saiyan. yeah. We offer a wide selection of Premium Genders™ here. defend Trans Girl Premium Gender™ at all cost. well, i mean. we're super pro-trans liberation. Trump replaces all the members of the Supreme Court with the Skeksis from Dark Crystal. Supreme Court trials are now resolved with Trial By Stone. please get me out of here ;-;. (. ypu. you've already got a bunch of fairies, . you're dating them <3. i don't think it needs to. pfft. nice. oh boy. white dutch people getting 'uncomfortable' at discussions of the racism of Zwarte Piet. really make me feel something strong. hm? what do you mean. oh man zwarte piet is such a shitshow every year. yeah probably. well. i mean, Zwarte Piet is a racist fucking travesty of a tradition. well i mean. this is what I've been hearing from Dutch people of color . so . shrugs. they seem to be in agreement that it's pretty fucking racist??? and pretty goddamn awful. i mean from an objective standpoint the blackface sucks. well, from some abstract analysis of the situation sure. but i mean, would you say black slavery is objectively racist. okay, what's your definition of it then. because by "object" I mean "represents the material reality of the way things actually are". s/object/objective. i mean, i guess anything is. but i'm not going to give credence to that whole thing when we're talking about like. nazis, etc. or racist Dutch politicians. but yeah, let's move on from some abstract philosophical fuckery. because it's useless in actually talking about this issue at this point in time. i mean from the way racists talk about it, hattusili_III. literally anything less than the Holocaust or slavery, is racism. err. literally anything less than the Holocaust or slavery, *CANNOT* be considered racism, in their eyes. or the people who say that "There's no sexism in the West" because their definition of 'sexism' is like...idk, women being stoned to death for adultery. i mean, blackface itself is racist. if sinterklaas had little magical helpers that would be fine i think. but he has helpers who are literally portrayed by white people in blackface. i mean, European society is really damn racist is the problem. white europeans as a whole. are you familiar with how religions absorb other religions? it depends on the religion i guess? it seems an overly broad question so maybe just say what you're thinking of. ah, i see what you mean. well. maybe. i mean, definitely with the no blackface thing. i personally don't care about Sinterklaas having magical helpers. Santa Claus has his elves . i really don't give a heck about the Sinterklaas tradition as a whole *except* for the fact that it has racist elements that white dutch people will, on average, explode on you if you suggest it's racist. from what I've seen and heard, at least. http://qz.com/307305/the-dutch-dont-think-its-racist-for-santa-to-have-black-slaves/. i'm just struck by the line: “It’s deeply, deeply sad,” commented Dutch prime minister Marke Rutte. “You can’t disturb a children’s party like that.”. i'm trying to think of anything analogous in the US. oh, i think the Confederate flag is definitely comparable in some ways. "don't deny our heritage and tradition" kind of thing. lots of people got uppity over the Mall of America here in the states hiring a black santa. vaesper, they don't want to explain to their kids that white people AREN'T actually the superior race. it may not be a conscious decision. but it's how white people in the West are socialized. http://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/santa-is-white-boycott-mall-of-america-online-racists-are-having-a-meltdown-over-malls-black-santa/. their nostalgia for when they didn't have to admit that black people existed and are people. severe tangent: the first Dutch horror movie is a hilarious shitshow of a film. have you seen De Lift, vaesper. well i recommend you watch this simply for the "so bad it's good" angle. i just realized. in the Rankin-Bass film of the Little Drummer Boy, the greedy villain character is extremely heavily coded with Jewish stereotypes. and the only other character who isn't some nondescript vaguely-white puppet is one of the Magi - Balthazar, I think. i think ableism is EXTREMELY related to feminism, enchi. especially because bullshit liberal white feminism historically has been willing to fuck over disabled women for its own gains. well, this is an intersectional feminist space. and i think discussing the many intersecting systems of oppression is always on-topic. besides, there is a non-zero amount of disabled people in this channel, myself included among that quantity. oh, i don't think you would be. yeah! I'm of the opinion that discussing any of the following should never be considered off-topic here: racism, ableism, ageism, the evils of capitalism, Marxism, etc. it's even in the rules:. "This chat room’s aim towards this subject is to create a class-conscious speech. Readers will note that speech has a class character, and that socialist feminists are against bourgeois speech. The aim of this space is to create an environment that promotes continuous discussion that accretes theory and knowledge.". well, i mean, our intersectionality/material basis is reflected in the rules, at least. but yeah, both actions and words are important. it's great if a space doesn't allow you to use ableist slurs but refuses to accommodate for autistic people with regards to sensory concerns. for example. yes. sorry, that was poorly phrased. it was meant along the lines of..."it's all well and good if someone does X thing to combat ableism but it kind of becomes jack shit if you refuse to take actions beyond changing speech patterns". for one, an autistic conference where journalists were asked not to use flash photography because of epileptic panelists. and a journalist used flash photography anyway. and my friend ended up chucking a pen at him. i don't even know. yeah, not in a deliberate way but more like. by 'deliberate' here i mean 'not in a way deliberately intended to cause harm' but that doesn't matter much. here, let me find a link to the incident. https://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2015/09/so-much-for-we-learned-from-our-errors.html. oh, it wasn't a journalist. https://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2016/04/i-know-why-your-child-acts-out.html. or maybe those were unrelated people. anyway, even conferences FOR AUTISTIC PEOPLE have trouble like. granting access needs? it sounds like that conference was for autism moms, tbqh. well, yeah. but i mean. like, actually being accommodating. yeah anything where allistics are involved. is gonna end up sucking for autistics somehow. allergy parents? what characterizes an allergy parent, elky. "autism parents" are a whooooole other ballgame. different sport, even. even the slightly-more supportive autism parents are...fucking terrible. yep! when i call up and ask about allergy accomodations and the person on the other end describes how they're an allergy parent and how they eat the same thing as their kid out of support then describe how they regularly eat at their work and suggest a thing with allergen in it. Autism Speaks released a video featuring a woman who was talking about how much she fantasized about engaging in murder-suicide with her autistic daughter. WHILE her daughter was in the room. saying that the only reason she didn't, was because of her allistic daughter. to autism parents, autistic people are seen as barely deserving of life? we're viewed as burdens who are best put out of our misery...or freaks with something wrong with us... our issues are often discussed in the context of our parents/allistic relatives and how much THEY see US as burdens... because doing nothing but being devoted to intellectual pursuits - in that you have your own emotions and struggles - means you're being autistic Wrong, sweetie. don't you remember? </sarcasm>. sigh, i remember being accused of being "emotionally ret*rded" by my parents. not the only context in which they swung the r-word... they'd yell at me how "even ret*rds can do this/understand this" and wondg why I wasn't able to. tbqh i have an extreme distrust for neurotypical parents of autistic people...if they're allistic but otherwise neurodivergent it's a little better, but... yep. so yeah, . you'd say ableism is a feminist issue, aye? ayup. feminism should always center the most marginalized people in its efforts. disabled women, women of color, trans women. especially when all those intersect. ayyup. indigenous women... personally i think feminism is worthless without incorporating Marxism and without dialectical materialism. "why should black men, who are basically subhuman animals in ADDITION to being men, have any equal standing with white women" is something some well-known suffragette said. yep here it is. //the-toast.net/2014/04/21/suffragettes-sucked-white-supremacy-womens-rights/. white suffragettes can fuck off. i should look into NYC wobblies. nice. //pro.politifake.org/image/political/1103/capitalism-socialism-and-communism-spelled-out-in-their-pros-political-poster-1299682478.jpg. wow nice analysis there. i feel weird because my Maoist friend has introduced me to many precepts of Maoism and...i think even an anarchist would do well to understand Maoist theory. there's a lot of value there. yeah. i think the mass line and protracted people's war are good concepts. but you see riddim. Deng was right all along, actually </sarcasm>. //i.imgur.com/6uJzf4x.jpg. i find that third worldists often seem to...hmm, how should i say...many of the twists i've encountered are like..."you can't complain about the hardships you face in amerikkka because the third world has it infinitely worse". yeah. sigh. i hope with Comrade Fidel's death the good people of Cuba will be able to continue to resist imperialism. i dunno if that'll happen, though... but you know, Cuban refugees in the United states *totally not rich batista bourgeois fuckers cough cough* like Ted Cruz are right about the brutality of the Cuban regime /s. i want the Black Panthers back. what about them, fluttrshy. apologists in what respect. to say nothing of actual, factual brutality that has been committed by socialist states, i think we must consider strongly the possibility that at least some of the reports of mass murder/atrocities. are capitalist propaganda. they deny the intentional mass starvation of millions of Ukrainian farmers. i certainly think a famine occurred but it's not like Stalin yelled at the weather to make that be the case. i think at the worst, there was bureaucratic mismanagement during the Holodomor. there's a large amount of actual evidence that the Holodomor was not intentional. i think we have to at least CONSIDER the possibility that what we have been told could be tainted with capitalist propaganda. and seek the truth of the matter with the knowledge in our heads that what we have been told could very well be lies. and from what I've investigated, it seems that at least some of it is. absolutely. i will not deny things that the Soviet Union did that were shitty. or atrocities. well, it was a socialist state, so by definition it's not communism. socialism is a transitory period . vanguard party and whatnot. communism is stateless and classless . but yeah, i think that a LOT of what we've been told about socialist states is propaganda. just like everything we've been told about drugs, or told about...well, lots of things, in the West. at the very least liberal scholars can't even get their story straight about what happened during the Holodomor. so even if it did happen, and not saying one way or another, there's a lot of misinformation even from tem. *them. yep. like we said, a famine occurred. famines can occur because of drought and natural circumstances beyond human control. i could be wrong, to be honest. but it seems like liberal scholars are to be skeptical of, at the *very* least. i mean, what do you think of Fidel? i mean, heck, Batista supporters/rich Cubans living in the US would have you believe he was a monster who boiled babies for soup stock. (exaggeration, but). can the dust bowl be considered an intentional famine? . 1) the capitalist elite lies about things that happen all the time and uses extreme propaganda to further its aims. 2) knowing this, it is valuable to evaluate causes that the capitalist elite lionizes, and see if what they sell you as fact is in fact fiction. America sold white people the notion that black people are dangerous criminal thugs hooked on drugs. (when in reality, it was advantageous to spread crack to black neighborhoods as a way to then spread this lie). see, i don't want to deny any mass killings. is the thing. but the problem is, it is at least very possible that not everything capitalists tell us is true, and from what I've seen, it's very possible that this incident (the so-called Holodomor) might not have been an intentional genocide. i wouldn't go that far, riddim. and i understand where fluttrshy is coming from. as (mostly) an anarchist, I've often been...reluctant to support ML or MLM because I've been critical of people in positions of power. and haven't wanted to condone any abuses of that power. so i can understand and have felt the...impulse to be very critical of power structures and to believe most any negative criticism of them because power structures suck . even liberal sources admit that kulaks burned their homes and fields and destroyed resources rather than submit to collectivization. which certainly doesn't help any kind of ongoing famine, manmade or no. riddim, i didn't even know about those things and yeah, that's shitty. anarchists are not incapable of being shit or committing atrocities. but yeah, the Soviet Union, along with any socialist state, is by definition not communist. because they're socialist - just want to clear that up. near its end, no, not really. //www.rationalrevolution.net/special/library/tottlefraud.pdf. //www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/Tauger,%20%27The%201932%20Harvest%20and%20the%20Famine%20of%201933,%20SR%2091.pdf. //www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/Tauger,%20Natural%20Disaster%20and%20Human%20Actions.pdf. //gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=32DAA2871728468189A57E0233492A3A. riddim, maybe they're not aware of that sort of thing. I'd be cautious of being overly harsh here. fluttrshy, i apologize if i've been overly harsh in talking about this, i want to present what i think to be true without being harsh. i understand why you would be very critical of the situation and wary of the possibility of mass murder having occurred. riddim i don't think being confrontational is going to get anyone anywhere in this discussion, comrade. well, I'm trying to use facts and reasoning to show that maybe this genuinely wasn't an incident of mass murder? and even liberal scholars seem to come to this conclusion more often than not. or that at the very least there's not a really great consensus . because a very understandable/predictable reaction to "fuck you, you're wrong" is to continue believing the thing . yeah, and that's valid. I. comrades. comrades i think we should stop. riddim, i think the confrontational tone is not helpful/useful in this scenario. irrespective of what fluttrshy has said. riddim stop. crit/self-crit comrade - it's propaganda that's understandably consumed by anyone living in the West. and hard to disavow oneself of . fluttrshy has demonstrated they are not aware of the history of how the propaganda was propagated or where it comes from. well, that wasn't productive of them either. but yeah. i dunno, I want to at least make an effort to convince someone of this point. because it's such a hard thing to get other people to even consider. (. um, we were discussing a point of contention. it's an emotionally-charged issue and i come at it understanding that this is the case. no one wants to condone mass murder or genocide or atrocities, it's understandable. well. consider that so many people are ingrained to believe this as true, riddim. and that anarchists are often very wary of abuse/atrocities committed by state actors. so regardless of the truth or not of an event, I think many anarchists are more likely than not to believe that an atrocity was committed simply because states are corrupt. and i like to remain aware of this. when talking about this matter. well, emotions were high at that point. i've gotten into states where I was unwilling to consider a reasonable or correct point because i was so upset. while the things you mentioned were true, i think it was unrelated to the discussion at hand and served only to feel like a "criticize X before you criticize Y", which i am not certain was the best way of going about it? idk. i don't think that's exactly true of . let's stop for a moment. everyone. is that in response to the discussion that happened early this morning, yar? it's definitely not about inter-group things, riddim. or about 'anarchists vs maoists' or any such thing. i think yar is bringing this up to say something solely about the interpersonal aspect between two individuals, of that exchange. yeah, i don't think it was the best way to approach the situation. i agree. i apologize if i acted in any way hostile throughout that disagreement/discussion. i don't want anyone to feel unsafe just over a disagreement like that. welcome back, yar. i think, though, the discussion itself can make people feel unsafe, which i understand. enough rope to hang myself with? i rebuked riddim for being pretty awfully confrontational. i don't think their conduct was at all proper. i don't think you were spoken to with any respect or dignity and i apologize. all i'm saying is. well, maybe let's not go there. yeah. i hate autism parents >_>. what's this about? the discussion? mmm. i'm not saying don't talk about recreational drug use but definitely make sure trigger warnings are given? just as a general thing. , what's your opinion on recreational drug use talk here. uh... ask yar. no, i don't mean what the rule should/shouldn't be. i am asking for your personal individual opinion on it. nods. i'm autistic and #wrongplanet is full of utter assholes. mostly Aspie supremacists. and people who don't see the value in attempting to be kinder to other people. people who have not bothered to examine their bias. yello. i made tonkatsu and curry for my gf last night. cooking is yum. . hi. hey , did you know i think you're kinda cool. i've seen you hanging around here a lot and thought you should know. nods. that would be nice. i must admit, i'm a bit of a...dog person, and it reflects heavily in my daily life. hope that doesn't bother you. :O. reeeeeeally? i'm glad my wife has a crush on me, all things considered. :3. why would it need to hold a lightsaber. she probably sleeps all day and eats...idk, banthaberries. or drinks blue milk. i see. have you seen Rogue One yet. nods. i understand. Darth Krayr. *Krayt. Darth Caedus. the Yuuzhan Vong. the Ssi-ruuk. the...idk, expanded universe Mangalorian lore. Trioculus. where's the 14-part cinematic universe centered around Thrawn. I'm glad we'll never see the Yuuzhan Vong in film. i think they wouldn't have been a good fit for a new series of films. can i just say that I have a disdain for Cans who think that Canada is socialist. and who position Canada as somehow above the ills of Western civilization. hello. L(. :(. i'm sorry, Roxie. turnips and parsnips are better than potatoes. yes. she's fine. Someone I know suggested that the physiological symptoms of depression are often overstated by doctors as a way of gaslighting patients/not investigating physical pain, etc. we don't even have the energy to try... crazy trans women can't just, you know, be *correct* about recognizing symptoms like chronic fatigue and chronic pain, right??? i swear to god when we actually were pursuing therapy last year for a bit, we were talking about our BPD symptoms with someone. and they were like "do you think these things could be caused by your dissatisfaction with your gender?". or something like that. like shut the fuck up and never speak to Mad people again you shitstain. Cans who insist Canada is socialist annoy the hell out of me. it means the government helps pay for roads! </sarcasm>. what exactly is it that causes people to ridicule feminism rather than analyze viewpoints . or rally around things like "manspreading" as supposedly-invented things for feminists to whine about (while ignoring the idea that men sure as heck take up a lot of space). mmm. also, no matter how many times it's explained to white dudes. they don't ever seem to be able to understand that "privilege" doesn't mean "you automatically have everything better" but "there are certain things you will never experience/have to fear because of who you are. ". i've been dealing with this for years and still can't...wrap my head around it. i know thinking outside your viewpoint is hard/it's hard to see something challenge your worldview but like...why are so many people averse to even trying in good faith? but who are the people saying "men are allowed to feel emotions, to break down, to need help, to be hurt, to reach out, etc". yeah... how do you present like...knowledge of what's happening without people interpreting it that way, though? oh? i guess i can see that. another reason why feminism needs marxism and dialectical materialism >_>. ugh yeah true. well. consider that a lot of "men's rights" types are really. fucking. misogynist. even though they'll SWEAR up and down that they aren't. i don't know if that's what the speaker was actually all about. but. shrugs. what about good old proud white men who just want to talk about issues affecting the white race? the funny thing is, the SJWs are talking aaaaall about how white men are the devil! I think legitimate issues men face under the patriarchy are...in places I frequent, discussed fairly heavily? I've never seen an actual self-identified "men's rights" activist who didn't have a deep undercurrent of misogyny and reactionary sentiment to their views. well, the people who are complaining about feminism not addressing those issues are clearly not frequenting those places. well. sometimes you can't avoid it. I don't care about making nazis angry or hurt. or white nationalists. there are some people you have to legitimately stop caring about the feelings of, because they will do everything in their power to ruin you while you try and appeal to their humanity. this is probably not the case of your run of the mill MRA. yeah. self-defense > all. oh hush. if they can be persuaded, I mean, sure whatever, but. shrugs again. i don't think that's necessary, The_Cat. suppress that mood please. s'okay. i mean, I could point out how you're biased towards your in-group of non-nazis. and how you've demonized the white nationalists. and maybe we should be more sympathetic in dealing with people who just want to be proud of their race. but fuck that, that's just nonsense. and anyone who does that is dangerously close to apologism. which will not be tolerated. I do think "how to speak to people such that they'll see the truth of racial stuff and not be persuaded into overt white supremacist thoughts" is a good consideration. but when they're flying the swastika in your face. you're right. you rip it up and kick them to the curb. sometimes you have to fight. sometimes, you gotta beat the shit outta nazis. help me do what better? It was more just me rambling in frustration rather than a genuine lack of understanding. but i appreciate it. ew voat. the place that was really eager to post porn of young girls. because "Swiss law". and also allow communities like fatpeoplehate because "muh free speech". it's a gross site. dunno why you'd go there. i think it's a wasted effort. i try and spend most of my time supporting and strengthening my community and loved ones and friends. i don't have the energy to invest emotional labour in "converting" someone. i've tried to be *extremely* patient and use a combination of reason and emotion when talking to people. my approaches never seem to succeed no matter what. I criticized the practice of ABA and one person claimed they were being attacked, and then later clarified that they *felt* like we were trying to attack her because she works in ABA. (Applied Behavioural Analysis, which is essentially just "force autistic kids to behave like neurotypicals because we hate autistics"). even though i said "I don't want to have this discussion be personal or involve anything personal about you because I don't want you to feel attacked, I just wanna discuss the matter itself". some people cannot help but feel attacked when a group they belong to is criticized. though I guess it depends on the criticism and the group, really. they're hesitant to admit, largely, that misogyny is a larger problem than "misandry". many of them view society as woman-dominated. these aren't just some dudes who think that feminists don't address issues affecting men under the patriarchy often enough... most MRAs refuse to acknowledge the structural basis of sexism altogether. yar, how do you even do that? I'd be unable to maintain any degree of significant personal connection to an MRA. mmm. so it's more, you extend care to him via your connection with her. ah. yeah. which is a real problem that needs to be address, i think. but that's not...entirely the same as playing nice when it comes to the people who have fallen fully into the hate movement. can you rephrase that. yar, yeah. no. i am good now thank you. i've never encountered any of the "need guidance" sort personally . at least, i don't think. no thanks. i only visit churches for the architectural significance. ...or the Cathedral of St. John the divine, but that's because they're not afraid to have anarchist/communist works/writings on display and they seem to not suck. . mmm. me too thanks. I'm a big fan of "working within the system" in the idea of "infiltrating it to gather information and then using information you gathered to destroy them from the inside out". like dating a nazi officer just to pass info along to the rebellion. or whatnot. I. mmmmmm. mmmmmmmmmmmmm. ah. ? 252 seconds). what's the 0_o for. public static void programming_reference(String userName) { System.out.println("hello" + userName); } . this.programming_reference(void);. oh damn. hattusili_III what lang . i wanna take a crack at rust. but I want to crack Haskell first. Crackskell. ah cool. i wanna contribute to a language someday. i have so much i wanna tackle tbh. i wanna learn OpenGL and SDL so i can mess around with doing graphics 4 fun. well that's the frickin idea . friendo. i'm messing around with linear algebra so I can at least try and make something. don't gonna let no one tell me i can't. gets real prickly. i know what all these things are and i stand by my conviction to make an attempt. worst case i learn something but don't go far. best case i learn something and make something cool. both cases, i tried, i learned, i win. i mean, i want to learn OpenGL in the context of SDL, is the idea. oh cool. i move a little bit slower in terms of pacing and stuff for learning, cranking out code, etc, but i have fun . i think linear algebra is pretty straightforward tbh. it's mostly remembg things for certain contexts and all the little moving parts that I think is the challenge. YES. thank you. crunchwrap supreme please. unironically loves taco bell. doritos locos tacos are good. trash food that I enjoy. put the tacos and burritls and the HECKING CUNCHWRAP into my body. hepp. heppy. ? what's a whoa. what did they do to get banned. exactly, I have no clue. ah. well, that happens. probably in some list of blacklisted users. me toothanks. *too thabks. *t o o t h a n ks. sorry i'm am new years drunk. oh boy. Portland, Oregon probably. i know so many socialist boys from Portland. Portland is apparently the capital of socialist trans men. from what I know of socialists, trans men, and Portland. yeah. i'm not much of a fan of Cascadian eco-nationalism but apparently it's a more or less okay ecosystem for socialist trans folks. are you Maoist OERIAS. ah. Maoism just seems to be a very popular thing up in the pacific northwest. not exactly myself. i am an anarchist who finds value in a lot of maoist principles. such as the mass linee. *line. oh nice. i wish i came from a biological family of leftists. nods. nods. <sarcasm> no i do not want to buy your newspaper </sarcasm>. It's just jokes based on stereotypes of Trots. any variety of leftist is better than a liberal or capitalist, I think. almost any. anarcho-primitivsts can fuck right off. I'm not familiar with them. googles. Wikipedia says they support NAMBLA? ??? wtf. is that real. why tho. but why though. gross. the Sparts of course ignore the power differentials between youth and adults in capitalist society. and the nature of consent . >We advocate the concept of effective consent—which means that as long as all parties involved consent to the act, nobody, least of all the state, has any right to tell them they can’t do it. . this is a very overly simplistic view of consent. eugh. i think people who are that kind of 'sex positive' completely fail to realize. the uh, you know, intricacies of compulsory sexuality in patriarchy. and how society simultaneously stigmatizes but also demands a narrow kind of sexuality . well. "let kids have sex with adults if both parties consent". kind of tihng. like we just said the Sparts advocate for. i personally don't believe simply having sex is a radical act - maybe the way you have it can be counter to the norm, but. being sexual in a specific, toxically masculine way is expected of men in patriarchy and demanded that women submit to in patriarchy. sex, in my opinion, is neither good nor bad. it just is. and people are allowed to like it or enjoy it, but the idea of it having osme intrinsic worth is ridiculous. the idea of sexuality necessarily being somehow core to humanity is ridiculous and needs to be eliminated, imo. I just wanna say HAPPY NEW YEAAAAAAAAARRRRR! (Sorry for sidetrack, the US is late). heppy. i find that people who apply "let people have sex with whomever they want and do whatever they want without question so long as it's consensual" don't like . attempt to criticize or analyze sexuality or consent whatsoever. err, apply that in an absolutist manner. people don't consider the concept of sex being able to harm people, even 'consensual' sex. even in a communist society where capitalism and the patriarchy had been abolished I would say that even then the best thing to do would be to, uh, not have sex with kids as an adult because fo the disparity that would still undoubtedly exist in like. life experience and things like that. bor. bork. //reductress.com/post/how-i-made-life-in-new-york-work-on-a-150000-salary/ Reductress is such a good satire . well, i mean. I read an article about how some rich new yorkers feel "very poor".

I really regret that I never like, screamed at them . or got to a point where I was willing to call them on their shit. s'okay. i am mildly upset because someone I know was (probably joking) making a thing out of the West Coast/East Coast 'rivalry'. i don't know why but anything like that, any pointless rivalry or hating on something that is pointless to hate on (like those "pineapple on pizza is a sin" memes) make me upset. yeah. Tribe? also, hi. i am puppo. chapbook?

I said "please don't yell at me" and she said "fuck off". apparently it triggered feelings/fears related to past abuse, like she would be hit/abused/denied food or something. which i can empathize with but that does not excuse or make it okay. at all under any circumstances. i don't currently have headphones. i was borrowing Willa's but she took them back. i will have to buy some soon. can i obtain them in-person? I would like to get them ASAP. okay. people have suggested that my lack of feeling really deep connections and emotionally relating to things is probably due to depression. i feel very analytical and literal and have like I have little use for relying on emotions about things. and it sort of feels insulting, the insinuation that the person I am isn't "me" but is clouded by depression. Like I'd magically have all these Feelings if I wasn't depressed. i envy people who like, watch a book or movie or show and are like "oh wow that was so moving, I cried, i related to it so much and i got so many feels". all I can muster up is "I enjoyed it because X, Y, and Z and give it good marks on cinematography and acting, but found Q and W aspects lacking:. yeah. i mean, I know I'm not. but the idea that me not developing those emotional connections simply because of depression is...idk. “That sounds more like depression eating your feelings than an innate trait”. ^ friend said that after I was talking about lack of spirituality and connection and emotion for things. you can see what/yeah definitely, what? nods. i don't know what to do about it. maybe it's ~all just depression~ and there's some magical me lurking beneath the surface. or whatever. i understand why people write poetry/sing songs about things like being trans, but I don't know if I could ever do it. i wish i had the emotional connection to anything to be able to write. heh, "excites". i just dunno that i have a strong connection to the concept of expressing mysel. *myself. i dunno. i can get excited about Things. re: photography, that's out of a desire to learn a skill I don't know and share an interest with someone I love. and I find programming fascinating and intriguing and curious and cool but i'm not sure how much I feel about it other than "wow so cool". it doesn't hold huge emotional significance to me, i guess? i dunno. it's hard to say when i'm this depressed, if the things I say are even true/accurate. a lot in what way? how so? sometimes. being yelled at really fucking set off our entire night. yeah... curls. i feel so lonely and sad and disconnected and lacking spirituality and lacking deep emotions. yes please. i want that too. i sort of want to do hangouts but don't know if I have the energy. it would be nice to have a decision made for me. ok. i'll probably be going right to sleep, is the tihng. would you like me to curl up with y'all? okay. call me? bork. nunum. let's that be us? yes please. are you okay, ? you're so gorgeous and lovely and amazing. and deserve all good things and love. our wife is gorgeous, isn't she, ? wiggles. ...we want to take care of you and be there for you always. borble. :(. yeah.

Jackie and I are barely different it feels sometimes. how. if we're basically the same person it doesn't even matter. except they'd be an entirely different person and we wouldn't share memories... it sucks. leads you to doubt self. unable to disentangle whose what is whose. what belongs to one. where the line is drawn. especially when you all like the same things...mostly identical interstes/disinterests. i wish i liked something she didn't. it was easier back when we were first distinct but now it's like....the constant overwhelming suicidal-ideation-inducing stress of this fucking nazi country is making it impossible to feel any joy in being ourselves. can you rephrease that last part please. ? i don't understand. ii mean we're not the same obviously, but... what we're upset aobut it... lack of MORE distinction. more individuality. yeah, i know. i was just clarifying what w'ere actually upset about. i dunno. i can't even think of anything we mgiht WANT to do differently, really... i like dressing more femme but we just wear the same thing every day mostly lately bcoz spoons. that mgiht be nice. i wanted to get my own little plushie in addition to francis. that only I would cuddle with, and same for Jackie. oh wow. i never considered the idea of taking photographs and labeling them as who was fronting while photo was taken. love too. drained, super depressed. been constantly fearful/anxious/depressed for weeks now. i don't think sio. it just feels awful. i want to be able to celebrate myself. i feel like i can't because there's so much fear in the way. anxiety. it's like, what's the point. if nazis just torture me and kill me in the ned. what do you mean. let's hope. i'm not optimistic. i hope. sorry I'm restricting us from having fun by doing nothing and being depressed. trying to think of way to feel like me right now. to feel distinct. feel good about me. feel good about ruby. Wonkavator. //images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F41.media.tumblr.com%2F4f668ada5623d45559d6dcca4d3cfb51%2Ftumblr_nkm3so6T4Y1r2vmy7o1_500.jpg&f=1. ? oh . can you call. well fuck. i'm defs not okay though. ok. no. not right now. thank you for your offer. i love you too. , ? love. love. it ok. bad. just bad. just bad bad bad. ok. i actually took my meds today so that's good. i was talking to earlier and idk what happened. if I upset her or did something wrong. or hurt her. i was talking to her about Lizzy (my friend) and she was talking about how she was trying to detach so she didn't spiral that way too. and then talking about how she feels guilty for not killing herself because she feels like she hurts everyone. and i said no, that wasn't true, that it would hurt even more for her to hurt herself. and i was just so numb and felt like i was being a burden so I said "I'll leave you alone now" on IRC and quit. and she said "I'm sorry I hurt you too" and I kind of freaked out a bit because she wasn't hurting me. and I said. “you didn't fucking hurt me ,my friend killed herself and i'm upset, okay? okay??”. and she said "I'll leave you alone now" and i haven't been able to talk to her. i dunno what to do. and i feel like she'll blame me. or something. yeah. i just dunno if I'll be able to get that through to her. sigh. it feels fake. Lizzy being gone feels fake. idk. i think i'm just not going to play these games to see if she's okay. if she's not she can just tell me. i'm not putting the energy into it. i doubt she hates me/will stay upset or whatever. it's just like. part of me thinks "why is it always all about her no matter what?". which feels awful to think. huh? no. it wasn't about anyone. and it's not REALLY like she's like that. it can just be frustrating. curl. i love y'all. hi. little better than yesterday i think. shrug. I had a dream that I was holding your face in my hands and giving it soft kisses all over, . and you looked so unimaginably gorgeous (because you are unimaginably gorgeous). and you were blushing a bit. <3. https://i.imgur.com/P3blZxp.gifv. what's the difference between a dirty bus stop and a lobster with boobs. one's a crusty bus station and the other's a busty crustacean. i love you too <3. i gotta get ready to go to . bork <3. good. <3. love love love <3. i already love you lots, <3. we didn't really have a "thanksgiving dinner". we had halal for lunch and chicken parm for dinner. shrugs. oh my gosh~. rolls onto back and presents tums. that's not weird at all~. that's incredible <3. i love you too~. gently~. i want you to come up behind me an nibble and suckle on my neck and kiss me while your hands wander and grope~. yes please <3. press me against the wall and put your hands up my shirt. unf~. puppy likes buns. oh gosh~. i fantasize about that actually. making out while you finger me and i moan. fuck me how? i dunno if my parts are great at it but I'd try~. nods. i'm mostly subby, but sometimes I'm not. i like being teased and played with . like a good girl. <3. i'm not good with taking charge in sexual situations. or being dommy. can i share a fantasy. being dommy to you and me, , at the same time...you with your choker, me with my collar...us both being teased and pressing against . yeah~. oh gosh. absolutely. 100& love <3. well, not necessarily like, inflicting pain or anything. just...exerting some kind of control? giving us direction. taking the lead. hgnnnnnngggh. oh my gosh. wiggles. i have this fantasy of and i being naked...on our hands and knees, right next to each other, presenting for you, . <3. pants and whimpers. or even in a non-kinky sense...just fantasizing about you sitting in my lap, (or me sitting in yours) as we make out gently and hold each other. <3. are youo kay, ? love you too. offers gentle holds. my lovely perfect birb wife. i want to hold your hand every day and spend my moments with you and make you smile. i wanna fall asleep while holding hands. and wake up and nuzzle against each other. and get up and go make breakfast and then take a shower, maybe together~. not even sexual or anything, just...intimate as we do tihngs together. yes please <3. fantasizing about...being at work and you come have lunch with us. yes please <3. bork. i suppose y'all don't understand, in terms of more specific than just referring to Islamic dietary law, what I mean when I say "halal food" in the context of NYC? so basically, it's rice with some meat (chicken/lamb usually) on top, with salad (lettuce + tomato) in the same box, often with onion, and then drizzled with a very specific kind of tangy white sauce and often a hot red sauce as well. there are as many variations and individual carts (it's pretty much a food you get at food trucks/carts) as there are New Yorkers. the term is overloaded - while 'halal' does mean the same thing as Kosher with regards to Islam, "halal food" also takes on the above meaning in the context of NYC food. it's....so....good. yes!!! i eat it all the time. they often also offer sandwich forms. halal food is a NYC institution. <3333. yayyyyy. //www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/51-reasons-you-know-youre-a-real-new-yorker this is actually pretty damn accurate. New Yorkers say "on line" as opposed to "in line". ie, "I was standing on line at the bodega waiting for my bagel...". do you know what an egg cream is? mmmm. ice-cold milk, seltzer water, and chocolate syrup. all mixed together. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_New_York_City. New Yorkers sort of have a love affair with red velvet. and pork buns. and ramen. the best bagels...and pretzels.. we will NOT be eating hot dogs at any street vendors. they boil them in water and keep them there and it's gross. we WILL be eating hot dogs from the infinitely superior Papaya King/Gray's Papaya, which have pretty darn good dogs. oh gosh~. name a cuisine and we have it. from a country, and we'll have it. heck~. oh. so it wasn't her fault? she didn't rob you? love love. wags. bork <3. licks. i love y'all so much. i love you too. when we're back in NYC. in , remember? <3. what do y'all define as "yelling". if someone got flustered after being asked a serious of questions and said, maybe with a slightly louder voice "I'm sorry, I don't know, Ican't give you the answer". would you call that "yelling". mmm. yeah. i was answg 's questions about something she read on my screen. and she kept asking - not maliciously -and i got kind of overwhelmed and was like "I don't know, I'm sorry, i gave all the answers". idk. it wasn't malicious or bad or anything. i didn't mind her looking at my screen, we have that mutual understanding. and she said i was yelling at her. and i'm not sure if I'm right to feel like I wasn't or if I am and I'm somehow bad and abusive. she wasn't interrogating me. just asking about a situation she was reading about on my screen. like, reading about something that happened and like. "why would they do X, was Y factor at play" (nothing major, it was actually about your train conductor yelling about no more boarding). 'was the train full, why would the conductor do that'. and i said that I didn't no and when asked more on the topic I was just like "I'm sorry, Ican't give you more answers " and was a bit flustered. maybe I did yell. i don't know . boooork. takes the _'s hand. bork. love my lovely loves. loves? bork !!!!! we love uou love you love you looooove youu. yes. leaving at 6:30 homeward bound. curls in your lap. !!!!! woah. <33333. did you see it? nods.

"we can't cut off ties with family" kind of thing. Angela (non bio mom) and Michele (bio mother) had LOTS of feuds over each others' respective biological families. Angela's family was super shitty to Michele and Angela's grandmother had kind of tormented Michele a lot. , yah. errr, by "you can't be too frank" i mean "it is inadvisable to be honest about your feelings". heh. we moved to a new town and moved into a new house when I was in 6th grade to caretake Angela's grandmother who was experiencing onset of alzheimer's. that caused some tension, for sure. and Angela's grandmother was HORRIBLE to me and my biological mother. everything had to be her way, she would berate Michele, there was constant tension. i got bullied a lot/had no friends in the new town. it was a fucking podunk rural town in Middle Of Fucking Nowhere, New York. i had no friends and nothing to do . and had to live with an asshole 65-year old woman who hated me and my biological mother. but talking about it with Angela was apparently taboo. Michele couldn't really even bring it up without it devolving into fighting. sigh. love. looking at streetview of old neighborhoos. dunno why. //hangouts.google.com/call/cvkueaiajncunos2mva6bcgfmee. //drive.google.com/open?id=0B6FkgM0PmGcgRVNEMDF3RmZsOTg. 260 seconds). it's Auropea, not Europe. //i.imgur.com/MGKpBSE.gif. //www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xynvrod0P6k. //scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15202740_1847379762175032_5764478640833607020_n.jpg?oh=d2ce7bf34345344236162f745922ac8e&oe=58BAB713. //www.facebook.com/pg/Undertale-%EF%BC%B3%EF%BD%94%EF%BD%81%EF%BD%99-%EF%BC%A4%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%94%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%92%EF%BD%8D%EF%BD%89%EF%BD%8E%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%84-1555907661378375/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1663717247264082. //drive.google.com/open?id=0B6FkgM0PmGcgNk00R2V1dnlEWU0.

Not_Die_Hard. hihi. (. what happened? i'm confused and worried. remember that weirdo who contacted me last night? no. i do not remember this. i remember the dd/lg weirdo who followed you and that's all. you and i never spoke about this . and if you and I did then I have a serious case of the memory issues. (. that seems weird and gross. oka. *okay. i love y'all. okay. yeah. clings to . did i do something wrong/have i made anyone upset at me. sorry. i woke up from a bizarre series of vivid dreams and my head is still in the dreams. the more i have vivid dreams (which unisom sleep aid seems to bestow upon me) the less i want to be awake and the more I'd rather just be dreaming. i was dreaming that Pokemon Sun and Moon were real but...it was weird. it was set in the real world, kind of - an alternate real world? with Pokemon. but other fantastical things too. <3. but I was...also a pokemon? so in addition to wild pokemon there were also separate, pseudo-pokemon sapient races. er, that's true. i meant...more like your generic fantasy 'civilized' races. i was some kind of...ghost cat, from Japan, and i was in the Alola region (which was actually a lot more like Brazil?) documenting the Pokemon of this newly-discovered/poorly understood region . and was trying to write a book but my (powerful) family told me it would never sell, except for my sister, whom i was close with. because apparently the Japanese market - Japan was largely populated by ghost-type people - was hugely inested in anything ghost-related and things outside of that were more indie, less likely to achieve acclaim in the critical eye. but i was passionate about my work. and then there were entirely separate, unrelated dreams in the dream. some of which referenced each other and had me explaining the dream to other dream characters in a nested dream. it was weird. but in the Pokemon part of the dream. i was actually catching Pokemon in this dense, jungly land. diving into rivers and streams catching water pokemon. 3. oh lord. god. i can't believe some places actually do this. lord. god damn. i mean, in a literal sense I do literally believe it. what i was trying to express was. outrage, frustration. <3. i love y'all so much. oh good god. //www.youtube.com/watch?v=p78EcFQLjHo.

Neo Genesith Evangeline. that sounds exhausting ;-;. 20 blocks is nothing in nyc. i don't have the energy to write most of the time. i can code/get code done in a day. writing fiction is harder than coding. code either works correctly or it doesn't. and you can diagnose technical errors. writing requires you to output something from within yourself. also, most of my ideas are extremely grand in scope, like huge sci-fi universes that I fantasize about. <3333. lil tiny birb. bestest birb. the puppy lying on the bed wags tail and gives the birb a sniff. borks gently in puppy confusion.

(. sorry that I didn't tell you in advance. or be there more this week. (. curls. I'm a good wife, loved wife, very cared for wife, even if I don't be around/on hangouts all the time. those aren't prerequisites for being loved <3. yes please <3. i love you so so much. , can i ask you a bit of a serious question? hmm. so, you and i are both exhibitionists/like showing off our bodies to other people and I feel really good about that/that's enjoyable. something inside of me is...idk, afraid of like, either you or having lots of casual sex with strangers, for some reason - maybe because while i enjoy sex as a part of intimacy, i fear it casually and how it can impact things emotionally? if that's something you want to do I don't want you to feel like I'm stopping you/holding you back. and i encourage you to do what you want to. i just wanted to talk about these feelings. nods. nods. nods. you and i have talked about this, . i guess...i've been in relationships where there was an element of the other person having lots of sex with other people. and it felt...idk, detached, like I (and maybe for them, everyone else they were dating) were just good lays they kinda emotionally clicked with. i don't know why I feel this fear. I feel like the Proper Polyamorous™ thing to do is just be 100% okay with all of my partners' relationships without reservation . nods. yeah... hmm... it's hard. for some reason I am much less threatened with the idea of my partners' dating/making new partners. than i am just casual sex. that feels scarier. nod. because something about the realm of sex without intimacy, without care and comfort and love and trust, just /terrifies/ me. maybe. yeah... i get the urges, i get horny, I want the sex, sometimes. as a means of scratching an itch. you mean the world to me, sweetie. yeah... it's not invalid for someone ot have other reasons for wanting sex, of course. it's just...i agree with you. i find that I have a hard time...jiving emotionally with people who put a lot of time/effort into doing sexual things purely for the sexual aspect of them. or, it generally makes me at least a little worried. ihope you don't feel like I'm saying I feel unsafe with you, ... i would enjoy that very much. do you feel...stifled/threatened by what I've talked about, ? oh no, absolutely not. i wouldn't mind...to the right people~. gotcha <3. certainly between you and I we can post them to our tumblrs. me? i dunno. never been around it. i want to make love to my wives. moreso than just..."fucking". <33333. yes please. i fantasize about just...blissing out as we squrim against each other. telling each other that we love each other. holding hands and falling asleep together. <3. <3. !!!!! TR8R. activates buzz baton. "TRAITOR". borks and flops. we made a cool accomplishment today wrt coding. we did some stuff purely functionally. which we thought was intimidating... but it's not nearly as much as we thought. nuzzle. i wish there were large expanses of raw wilderness nearby. so i could just...go explore them. maybe with people. yus. there aren't many nearby. i might take a trip out to Long Island and just explore into some wilderness/one of the state parks. !!! yus~. i can't wait to wake up next to you and every day. is it weird to say... that even though we've been in love for so long...that i still want to "get to know" you and ? that i love learning more/becoming closer . do you feel like there's things about me you don't know? <3. long walks together sound nice. how do you feel aobut the idea of taking regular walks . nods. yeah...it's hard for me too. i like being indoors much more than being outside in the open. it's not so bad if there's lots of tall buildings densely packed around me. i don't like open spaces very much. unless it's like, wilderness, i guess. idk that's probably just normal. i love you too <3. heck. that's me. <333333. Mulan am good. P. yes. Gizmo was supposed to turn into Stripe. also Billy. Billy's mom was supposed to get decapitated. and we were supposed to see them eat Barney. there was also an idea for the Gremlins to be in a McDonalds, eating people instead of fast food. oh yeah, best scene in the movie. exploding-head scene made it PG-13. yes. we don't even get her name...do we?

Lynn Peltzer. her name is Lynn Peltzer. ...not an improvement over Barbara >_>. . but...i never wanna make you sad~. hah. i dunno if I have SAD but if i did would it be weird to love snow. yes please... i wanna have my tummy kissed and nibbled on... i like receiving kisses in that area between my dick and belly button. oh my~. whaddaya wanna snack on? ;). presents self for noms. what do you wanna eat first?~. which part of me would be most delicious. yeck. wiggles. what part of me you wanna eat first ? y'all love my tums. tums is very popular with wives. hng~. dessert, or the main course? ;-;. hng. gremlins 2 is a crazy movie. and is amazing. <333333. cute cute cute face. <333333. such beautiful mine wife. yes please. yes please <3. what kinda wedding y'all want? skittles are yum. heck. had to reboot. yeah.... what kinda wedding we gonna have? what kinda rituals do we want to engage in, if any? hu. yus. bork. and I are making a huge amount of fried chicken tenders/nuggets. wiggles. you're yummy~. good. happy. cooking. says she's alive. that's how she's doin'. bork. how are you, hon? :(. fireworks suck. i wish i were there to hold your hand and wrap around you and keep you safe. bork. yes please. holding hands, watching a movie/show. me spooning you bein a big bork spoon. i love cuddling. premium wife cuddles™. wow...we made so much chicken. 3 whole pounds of chicken breast turned into chicken tenders/nuggets. they're really damn good, too.... wanna cook for you and . //i.imgur.com/Glaq8uf.jpg HALLO YAS I AM REAL PORKEMAN.

"shot", that will spread out in the traditional scatter . most people think of shotguns as scatterguns, which they usually are, but they don't have to fire shot. a slug is yeah, just a big single hunk. i dunno. P. sigh. me too. did you know that NY is 5th in the US in terms of onion production?? for agriculture. and ranks first in the nation for production of yoghurt, sour cream, and cottage cheese. New York state total production of apples in 2015 was over 1.35 billion pounds of apples. ...sorry, I spent most of today looking up the agricultural statistics for the US, mostly NY >_>. all. all the kinds of apples. NY apples are so good. yes :>. we can go apple picking. NY orchards often act as tourist locations in addition to being places where you can pick your own apples. get a bag, load up on cheap apples, pay per pound. they usually have like a building/barn where they sell other stuff that's been produced on the local farm. cheese, butter, maple candy, maybe some honey . yes~. it's not a winter thing...more of a fall thing. just means you gotta come during september <3. NY apple cider is some of the best, though. :(. . what does your garden grow usually. hipster is complicated. bork. <3. still in but maybe. i'm sleepin' by myself tonight, we went through the rotations of sleeping partners. i told you already. well... usually plays World of Warcraft until 7am and so and don't sleep together much. so I end up sleeping with one of those two when I visit them. but 's been away for like a month so she wants to sleep with for a night or two. also, 's bed is not big enough to sleep three comfortably. okay <3. sweetie... . i love you for you. sex is not a necessary part of our relationship. just loving you and caring for you and being with you is what I want <3. you're my wife and 's wife and we want you. sex is much less important than caring for each other and being together and sharing our lives . gently rests head in lap. heh. yeah~. <3. exactly. exactly what said. "butt stuff" is like, one of the last things I think about when i think about being with you. holding you close...listening to you and making you feel loved...providing for you. helping you feel safe. helping you feel understood and valid and happy. those are way better~. me. i'm sorry . chocolate milk is yum. pudding is also yum. would you accept rice pudding if we made some for you, ? maybe some chocolate-covered shortbread cookies. heck. <3. bork. i love y'all. probably. yes pleeeeease <3. sorry do i talk to y'all enough. interact with y'all. message, hangouts, spend time, etc. what thing. but yes wanna. cuddles. me too. i like kisses. kisses and pressing up close. eeee~. yes please. i wanna be in a cuddly wifepile with y'all. just nuzzling and telling each other we love . god yes. hmm...that sounds perfect :>. e<3. yu. lemme get set up. http://www.battlebotsupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/s6e1_lisa.jpg. love y'all. bork. bork wuff heck sniff. bork. are you okay . :(. i love you. sorry. is there anything I can do. okay. i'll be home tonight. hello welcome. i am bup. welcome to bup. wives wives wives. yes. hyes <3. wiggle. i love you <3. rwoqpekgjfdnwi0qr-opkjbdhwiqr90-3wofksbg. wait. whaaaaaat.

I bet would get a kick out of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6fceLfjB4s. noone. we were talking about violent intrusive thoughts/fantasies we have. it's hard to deal with. it's easier NOT to try to deliberately push them away, though. you can buy them in subway stations at machines that accept cards and/or cash. some stores also sell them but this is less commonly done. yes, if you do not exit via turnstiles, you can stay in the subway indefinitely and transferring. so, you want to get to a station that has a transfer to the service you so desire. <33333. yes. well. don't buy 'single rides'. they're more expensive than just putting individual monies on the card. yeah. yeah <3. frowns. "you're new to Python, right?". no, not really, i just forgot that string.replace() doesn't mutate in place. i feel like this person who was just helping me assumed I was a beginner just because I forgot the behaviour of a stdlib function. such wonderful meepmorps. and the uke! //www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAkf4B_Ff3M.

Cat! iliek your hair. has amazing hair. Simon and Garfunkel are pleasant musicians. Naga, go? to hospital. mmm. it was some mistake I should never have made. i KNOW the way X thing works. i guess it's because I've been socializing and thinking and doing things all day and my brain is fogged. idk. it wasn't at work or anything. it was while pair programming for some little fun activity. and I can't help but be mad at myself. i feel like a shit programmer. i know.... i know it doesn't mean much. it's just some random thing I did after hours of socialization. which already has me a bit frazzled. yay. that's a happy. hi kye. are you okay? though YMMV absolutely. wheeee. sporpsbol. gets petted. more pls!!!! wagg!! sigh. i just want things to be good and cool for everybody. my first act as president would be to dismantle the gov't. and everybody work on mutual aid. and no more capitalism . weighted blanekts for everyone. no more neoliberalism, no more wars. i'm officially endorsing Weight Blanket for president 2020. with their running mate, Chewy Stimtoy. lizards are good little pups. yes. you good photograffer. can we just try and hold off. this is causing a lot of people anxiety. can we do no more election talk? me fucking too MiseryMyra. err, . mio. we're all fucking stressed. lots of people are afraid. and have the right to be. many of our freedoms will suffer. yours are valid too. yeah many of us don't need more stress from constant reports of awful things happening. i love y'all. i just want to go to sleep. i love you all. i love you Dragoness. i'm here for you. wraps around the naddo. I'm wondg if I should use WHONIX instead of MacOs. OSX is fine. oh? what's megestrol? I positively cannot believe the people who think that Trump is "keeping LGBT people safe from the radical Islamic terroristS". i just. i don't understand it. yeah... I think cultivating a certain degree of distrust of everyone around you might not be a bad idea. idk though. stay safe, . be well and we love you. Modi is horrifying... While I agree re: Modi - did you have something specific in mind when you said that? oh, just...was reading about the whole 500/1000 rupee thing. just about stuff he'd been doing. i was reading an article. can they exchange the bills to smaller ones? , most people here might not know what lac/crore are: would you mind explaining? . curls around . holy shit. http://www.clickhole.com/article/taking-stand-disney-will-add-donald-trump-its-anim-5143. "Being a company that caters to diverse families, we felt it was a moral responsibility to have Mr. Trump’s robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations, while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death.". alternate plan, replace trump with the robot. the old switcheroo. like, why torture an innocent robot when you can torture trump himself. mm... yeah. probably just not good for her to talk about/be around. it's okay. honey.... sigh... they don't understand that Trump is placing vehemently anti-LGBT people in positions of power. they don't understand that a Trump win is emboldening the KKK and white nationalists. do they not understand? or do they not care. they don't understand that "radical islam" is in many ways due to US intervention and imperialism. individual trump supporters might not hate queer people. but so many do... they don't understand the basis of so many societal issues. the whole "globalist" thing is really awful... like, the way they think about it. i mean like. neoliberalism does suck. idk.... do you think there are Trump supporters who really truly think queer people will be safe? i mean, maybe they do...but they don't understand that the current climate is going to really undo so much of that. i dunno. i mean, they don't understand. that like, many people don't like Trump OR Clinton. why are people so awful. why is humanity such shit. i can't help but feel somewhat guilty that I didn't do more to give emotional labour to people who might support Trump. and try and convince them away from it? i mean like. so many problems with hillary too. i wish there were a foolproof way to protect against state actors. like, one thing that the_donald was saying re: the KKK is "oh but Hillary called some KKK guy her mentor!". it's all like...they pull out things they hate as an anti-Hillary thing but can't even attempt to consider the scary implications of the KKK endorsing Trump? i dunno. i think i'm trying too hard. i know... i mean like I have no great love for Hillary either. they're both criminals. yeah... despite being kind of an ass about some things I think we need to all be following RMS's advice more. Richard Stallman. head of the Free Software Foundation. really big into encryption, privacy, etc. oh just like. all of it. basically, "free software, privacy for users, user control of programs". he doesn't use like, key-fobs at work because of the potential for tracking. uses plain metal key to get into the building. he's THAT kind of guy. yeah true. RMS is a bit...off . in some things. wut. in a biology thing or a furry thing. an RMS thing, I think. oh. i'm not surprised. oh right. ohhhhhhh right. it's the whole "no censorship of any kind!". "all information should be free". yeah... i forgot about that. yeah it's like. he'd literally be in favour of legalized/protections for like, the free exchange of kiddie porn. not the people who raped kids! but the possession of the content itself and distribution of it. it's not really about RMS and squicky stuff...it's about the fact that he wants to protect content that violates and abuses people. on the principle of freedom of information. ALL information, all content, regardless of what it is. though he's also really big into privacy... so... he's...kind of a fuck. unfortunately in times like these. sometimes it is inevitable that we cause suffg as a reaction to protect ourselves. very high. waffle? where were the white men saying that we need to give Obama a chance. the exact same white men were calling Obama the antichrist. let's hope a Trump presidency doesn't strip that away. Have you been here before, MSax? Ah. Well, welcome. yeah... i would recommend getting that done ASAP. do you have name/gender marker change paperwork? yeah...it sucks. ugh. ughhhhhhh. god i'm so sory for you. i dunno. i really can't say... i worked at the GAP a few years ago and was there for a year, and no one said anything about taxes/markers/etc, and I hadn't changed anything . but in Texas... nods. it's hard. and unfortunately i can't promise that it won't get harder. what I can promise is that there will be people looking out for you that will fight for you. at least you don't get the dreaded, spoken-with-venom "what are you, a man or a woman". nods. may i ask where you work/what it is you do? nods. do you get free ice cream? bork. Neoliberalism failed the working class of the United States and Trump seized upon that anger and pain and disappointment. Sadly, he won't be able to deliver on his promises. And the white middle/working class people will soon realize this. doggooooo. and yes, we are surrounded by fascists. offers hug to Audrey_Emma. you're not being difficult. 3, as in 3 individuals. or 3 million individuals. i hate capitalism and the US political machine. by default. kitty. yep. kitty good. :(. mirrors are a lie invented by the Luxembourgish . yikes. , maybe you should poll the entire room. instead of putting individuals on the spot. it might make one person feel really overly focused on in a situation. or uncomfy. >two people living in my brain. OH BOY I WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. :D. heck. I've been having such a hard time expressing myself verbally lately. I start conversations or say things and people just look confused/have a hard time figuring out what I'm saying. I was trying to explain how I want to learn more embedded programming, and I was trying to express the idea that with an Arduino, I have a much better concept of what I can do/what is possible, but I feel intimidated by like, embedded stuff. and the person I was talking to looked so confused at what I was saying like it was barely comprehensible. someone please talk to me. did anyone like. read it. i have a hard time interacting too. what I just said. I know that there's nothing fundamentally wrong with my understanding of things. but my ability to actually explain things lately is just fucking shot. I'm in a state of constant anxiety lately. worrying that I or the people I love will be shipped off to a death camp or something. I tried to ask someone last night "Hey, are you also waiting (by the door) to go get food?" because a bunch of people were going to get food together. and what came out was absolutely incomprehensible. apparently. I generally prefer to communicate via text. It's easier for me to see what I'm saying and then adjust it if I realize there's an error. and it's not like I don't think before I speak, which is such a silly thing to recommend to people in this kind of predicament. getting to not wearing a bra for 3 months is gonna be awesome. I managed to write something that can read from a socket. and actually got it to display . no. she needs to stop doing that, also. kitty <3. sigh. there was a police siren just now that was running with a very sustained tone and it sounded like some sort of air raid siren . holy heck. these corn fritters are really good. all of these fuckers who are saying "The Army Corps of Engineers and others signed off the Dakota Access Pipeline as being safe!" need to shut the fuck up and never speak again. of course they're going to sign it off as safe. eyyyyyyyup. who's edie? oh. right. i'm scared of pain . regardless of whether or not that's what they want, i kinda don't care because I just want to avoid pain. someone please tell me something lovely and encouraging and sweet and cute. is nice, ja. what's that. not prozac, but "yawngasms". a person named 'virr' is in the lobby. should I try to see if they're an okay person first before inviting them. they are asking to be invited. aww. curl. glass| can i ask u question. plurality-related. is that ok? how do u manage individual interests/etc, if that's something you do. like, we feel like we mostly just like/do the same things. and it's not a good feeling. blendyness and such not fun or good. but? mmm. there's only two of us here (as far as know) so.... mm. mmm. is it wrong of me to be annoyed at people who almost exclusively only ever message me to talk about things related to themselves. no one here in this channel does this nor is it about any of you, to be clear. i mean like. actually it's only one person. who i get weird feels about because iwant them to like me more. i shouldn't have couched it as being about people in geenral. i don't know why I did that. it's actually literally just one person on Facebok i'm talking about. sorry. well, it depends on what you're doing. it's not a hard and fast rule. yeah. ni. today is bad. c. friend died. trolls have somehow invaded the fucking facebook post she used as her suicide note. and are posting horrific things. *their suicide note. i didn't notice pronoun switch, it must have been recent. nope. well, that's not true... they used IRC actually. i have no idea. how would I know that? oh. i believe they went by LizzyQueer or something similar. i mostly interacted with them on FAcebook. A lot. they were amazing and wonderful. (. it's 1pm. did you already eat dinner/. bork. i am bork, more or less. shurgs. heck. cars suck. America is ridiculous and doesn't unederstant the value of public transport. it's that "rugged individualism". i don't really care about the holiday of Thanksgiving itself but i do sort of wish i could have the "everyone get together to share a meal and be happy together" experience again. HECK YR BUTT INTO A BED SLEEPAMY. ugh, Mio... that was very inappropriate when other people are talking about their experiences with abuse. , no... enby POC exist... people of color who use neopronouns exist... it's like. the gender binary is a white supremacist Western construct anyway. offers many hugs and pets and loves to . you are wonderful and that person is awful. you did nothing wrong. we love you becca. what does that mean. "no more boarding". ugh. was it full? no. Emma_Audrey, you are allowed to want your body to be whatever you want. wanting/having boobs is not a prerequisite for being a woman. and not liking/not having breasts does not invalidate a person as a woman. bork. did you get another job? okay. are you getting paid? noms on peanuts. slathers in gochujang. i could eat gochujang out of a jar. it cold. take a minute to calm down, breathe, have a glass of water, etc. yikes. (. i love you . , take a breather, get some water, etc - might not alleviate these feelings entirely but it'll make you feel slightly better. yes it does. please take some time to self-care. does it count as pica if we used to eat, regularly, grass/twigs/leaves/paper/insects. and would sort of just do it whenever given the opportunity. no you don't. Pseudicus Latinium. For Grandus Effectarium Dramatica. hiii. goddamn beer hipsters fucking Chicago beer snob assholes. you call a brewery "revolution brewing" and put all this anticapitalist coded imagery everywhere. //revbrew.com/home. and it turns out it's just marketing/symbols and you're not actually commies/anarchists? i can't find any actual indication that any of the imagery is anything more than just for marketing. that they're actually down for the revolution. steal all their bourgie beer and drink it in Haymarket Square. doesn't look like they are. a co-op, that is. I'd rather a tall raktajino. next time she comes back. I'm not letting that slide. stop it and listen to us for a moment. no. nothing is more fucking annoying than when you are profoundly autistic and have extreme difficulty extracting the meaning from what people tell you. and they get frustrated that you need to literally re-explain what they said to them to make sure you understood it. also. i fucking hate "oh, I thought it was obvious that I was saying X when I said <thing>". i hate hate hate it. MAYBE IT'S NOT SO FUCKING OBVIOSU!!!!!!!! i was trying to get help with a programming concept from a friend. there was a central concept i didn't understand because i misinterpreted what someone said. and they said "oh, I thought it was obvious that I meant X". curls around . i was trying to be really polite i think. i dunno, I just hate that people get frustrated with me when i don't understand. (. also, hi . , still here? you do not look like a man . someone is trying to argue with me that I shouldn't joke about "white people spicy chicken wings" because white people invented buffalo wings. which aren't even that spicy to begin with. "I'm white and I love buffalo wings". , the stereotype of white people is that they mostly cannot handle spicy food. //www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/spice-lover-orders-mild-curry-6506732. it was more about the spice level, , than the wings themselves. well i'd say that's more a hypermasculinity thing than reflective of white 'culture' as a whole. garbanzos are good. the joke is also that white people as a whole underseason food. Drey_Emma, no, of course not. but it's...reflective of the blandness of 'whiteness' as a whole. how things that get subsumed into whiteness become associated with blandness and plainness. //www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/23/291525991/when-vanilla-was-brown-and-how-we-came-to-see-it-as-white.  i wonder that too. I think gulyásleves still was a thing just not very paprika-y. onions and caraway and carrots, it looks? i drink worcestershire sauce . i love mustard. i'm kind of a spice fanatic. sometimes I like to just fuck my face and sinuses up right proper. sour is amaze.  agree or disagree, capsicum is the greatest edible plant. handstands noo. I'm a big fan of complex flavours. , did you know that telling jokes about orthography is most fun if you do it in a grave accent. orthography jokes are so fun, except when people are overly diacritical of them. i could tell linguistics jokes all day long, but i'd rather do them spoken, because in text you wouldn't get any sense of inflection. and if that were the case, it might make things a bit tense. sorty. *sorry. okay. I'm just a bit lonely today. hi Dragoness. <3. and yeah, the societal expectation/norm os that neurodivergent people are bad. burdens. sick, disgusting. crazy. ??? they said WHAT? oh man. i did NOT know that this writing community I was a part of. has so many communists in it. ☭☭☭☭☭. <333333. eeee! coming over in what capacity, though? where'd you be staying. I remember you having a guest room. but there's also your roommates... ooooh, maybe talk to and , ? but i don't wanna grow up to be wally bear. i wanna grow up to be me. I wanna be just like when I grow up. looks dreamily at . hmm...can i aspire to marry you, then? <3. .... she should fucking enjoy giving the gift because YOU want it. get her a bag of celery for christmas. "this makes me happy to give you!". "i enjoyed giving this gift". 260 seconds). am I bi if I occasionally look at gay furry art with boy furries. i'm actually pretty ace tbh. hi Snowmew. you is snowmew? hi. nope. snuggles FaeFennec. bork. , you are. cis people don't ask that. it's not a thing that enters into the cis realm of thought. studies? idk. why do you ask. but like, literally, people who are cis do not spend the amount of energy you do. on questioning/feeling invalid. cis people just don't really care/it's not a thing that they think of at all. yeah. 1.2 years of pain and hardship and having it dominate yr thinking. cis people don't do that. congration. not everyone picks up on/understands body language though __. right. righ. *right. yeah, though. that's kind of not what i think  was asking. "is it ableist to use the term voiceless because of people who might be incapable of producing audio via speech". yup, that's what I was thinking when I asked the question. well, that's what  was asking. and trying to figure out. what rhetoric is that. i don't understand. can you please concretely clarify the word/phrase/term you are proposing be a replacement for "voiceless". well, this isn't just about first amendment. this could apply to any country or any marginalized group, I think. so yeah. , i totally get where you are coming form. *from. I'd say "subaltern" could be a word to replace it potentially but I'm unsure of that's deviating from its original postcolonialist meaning. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaltern_(postcolonialism). a subaltern is a person rendered without agency by social status.[. right. i'm well aware of what  meant by it. well, though. read the "denotations" section and what Gayatri Spivak had to say. i'm just not sure. yes, of course. but I'm just saying "I'm not sure if it is most advantageous to use that specific definition or to use it broadly". , who would you consider "voiceless", specificaly? , what do you mean? i don't think non-speaking people need to express a problem with it for it to be a point of consideration. or for us to examine the potential ableism within everyday terminologies. I was thinking of trans people for example. Or... I'm currently also thinking of how, on FB yaraju feels "voiceless" coz coming out will lead to all kinds of repercussions. i'm looking at a few articles that challenge the idea of "voicelenessness" altogether and suggest that there are only the deliberately unheard, the silenced. or, to be precise, those who are deliberately left unconsidered or restricted from being able to discuss/communicate/etc. well, by "communicate" I meant "unable to discuss their issues/have their issues recognized by society at large". right, yes, that. i've come to be fond of powers of 2. yeah. da. idk, i'm not an expert on colonial theory. but i think the original idea was that there was a colonizer/colonized relationship. and that...the colonized people could not have their voices heard except filtered through the lens of the colonizer? though it also seems like a fuzzy term. i think one of my friends described it as..."a group that has not reached the level where their participation in political discourse is even considered/paid attention to". or something like that. so i think there's a disparity between a narrow, specific view, and a broader view. i'm not sure which seems the most useful in the context of this discussion. my friend suggested, for instance, that plural people are subaltern because their voices aren't even considered or acknowledged as existing as being relevant to the discourse about things affecting them. and if people are discussing plurality, it's entirely filtered through the lens of how society views it, such that plurality itself becomes defined by the majority. yeah, is 'subaltern' just a term for marginalized people, or does it refer to a group that is so far under the radar that the very concept of their existence is defined in the social hegemony by the majority? ah. here we go. //www.academia.edu/3644590/Can_the_Subaltern_Speak-_Summary. yeah, that seems to hit upon it, . "The "subaltern" always stands in an ambiguous relation to power-subordinate to it but never fullyconsenting to its rule, never adopting the dominant point of view or vocabulary as expressive of its ownidentity.". i think for this reason, a lot of people feel more comfortable identifying with "queer" rather than specific acronyms. i know i certainly feel better about that. ! that's me. ). thank you. BORK. BOOOOOORK. bark bark bark . offers hug to sleepyamy. love you FaeFennec. or us. FaeFennec? no sorry FaeFennecs. you good. the music you make is good. and lovely. sigh. //news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/feathered-dinosaur-tail-amber-theropod-myanmar-burma-cretaceous/?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=link_fb20161208news-feathereddino&utm_campaign=Content&sf45504119=1. iiiii. <333333333. ohhhhhhhhhhh. ohhhhhh. n.....nooooooooooo this is the best thing ever. i can't. too good. what about elky? bork. "you understand what I meant" is pretty much entirely a bad thing to say to someone. yes. right. that might be the only possible valid usage. also. if someone asks you to clarify something you said/asks you directly what you are telling them to do. telling them "what do you think/go read what I said again/etc" is shitty. do people often conflate "you're not listening to what I'm saying" with the person they're talking to not understanding what they said? hmm. i think that's definitely often true. but what I meant was "do you think it is possible that some people conflate listening with understanding". and will accuse someone of not listening to them when they are not being agreed with, or when the person they're talking to doesn't understand them? irrespective of the phenomenon of people talking over others, etc. not to say that this is always what people mean when they say 'you're not listening' or that it is even true in most cases. but moreso, is it possible that it could be true in some cases, and have you ever experienced it? sorry . do i qualify as learning disabled? you did nothing wrong, i'm sorry, i had to get up and couldn't get quassel not to crash on my phone (common problem). okay. sometimes i feel that communicating with humans is a worthless endeavour. it's especially hard when I try to clarify precisely what i mean after every turn. and people act like I'm stupid for that. <33333. <3 . iii~. howdy. good, you? mmm. that sounds yum. i'm a big fan of sauteeing cabbage. cabbage is good. i can get savoy cabbages at the market for $1.50 a head. cabbage is best consumed sauteed imo. do you ever just feel like... a great disdain for humanity in general. ooh nice. aww. curls around FaeFennecs.

"some other phrase relevant to the situation". what's with those memes. what's it form. *from. found it! http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-am-forcibly-removed-from-the-premises. this is a very 2016 meme. BUP. wiggles. just saw Rogue One. amaze. simply purely amaze. <3. is Tumblr weirdly not loading the HTML/CSS properly for some blogs. wait, who's getting married, AliceMarie? oh. well technically. heh. is it wrong of me to think that it is...perhaps an overly limiting thing for someone to say "I won't watch the new Star Wars movies/The Force Awakens because i know I'll think the originals were better and nothing will ever live up in my opinion". no... i didn't say anything about there being anything wrong, . i just am trying to grok that mindse. *mindset. because i like to judge things on their own merits. and while i love Star Wars and have even gotten into EU kind of stuff at times, there's no reason to me why new content made by different people couldn't be good. well, i mean, in terms of transphobic/racist/awful shit, yeah. like what? i saw the first...two? . the first two hobbit films. and yeah, they lost the spirit of LotR something fierce. but i'm glad i saw them (I didn't pay money to see them, i watched them on DVD or whatever after the fact). yeah..... the hobbit movies went off the rails so much... wow... oh, yeah, no one *owes* movies a view. i'm just trying to put myself into that mindset/understand it. because I personally would rather watch something and say "that was trash" than not watch it, because heck, there are people who find trash enjoyable. or maybe I am one of the few who don't find it trash at all and i eat it up like. i thought the first new one was kinda fun in some ways but also kinda trash. and then Into Darkness was *really* trash. and i haven't seen Beyond, though people have said it's very oldtrek. so i can't judge. meh, it's not like a big plot point so i think yr okay. the idea of a Trek reboot is not a bad idea, fundamentally. but i think it was poorly handled. would been better to have a movie that segues directly into a TV show, in my opinion >_>. , Rogue One was fantastic. I cant wait to see it with you and ina few weeks! <3333. i wanna see it again. we have to see A New Hope directly after tho. oooh. yeh. that sounds nice. <3333. if we ever do watch the prequels, I suggest doing it "hatchet order" . which is A New Hope -> Empire Strikes Back -> Attack of the Clones -> Revenge of the Sith -> Return of the Jedi. yeah, but cut out Phantom Meance. *Menace. yeah... because Attack of the Clones, despite sucking, introduces Anakin better than Menace. and does set the stage for the downfall of Anakin, etc. me too, mostly... oooh yeah. that one isn't bad. though the "Skips" thing with Ahsoka Tano is a bit hard to get by...Anakin seems like a Pretty Okay Dude in the Clone Wars cartoon from what I've seen, which i guess isn't bad, but do they portray any of his downfall? i like the *idea* of the story of Anakin Skywalker and the fall of the old republic, is the thing. i like to laugh at the prequels. it's like watching Plan 9. i think the prequels could have been amazing had George Lucas not had a army of yespeople attending to his every whim. i want to travel into the alternate reality where the prequels where amazing masterpieces of cinema . i keep trying to move objects with my mind and being really...dejected that it doesn't work. even though I know it won't work. why can't we just have like, individual stalls with doors that close all the way. and no spacing underneath the dividers. like, that seems sensible. jumps up, shouting "EUREKA!". i finally figured out what the bug in my program was!!!!!!!!!!! well yeah. i've done it many times before. it happens all the time. this one was just...a particularly annoying one that had been plaguing me for several days. capitalist society definitely exploits and objectifies workers. extraction of surplus value from workers is a cornerstone of capitalism. god bless what. is that sarcasm. are you being sarcastic by saying "god bless capitalism", janet. or was that a legitimate defense. why? by "extraction of surplus value" I mean of course the idea of buying a worker's labour at less than what it's worth. and using it to create profit for the capitalist. no, i think it's indefensible. i think capitalism is a blight upon the planet. why shouldn't labour have the right to all it produces? why should we have no ownership over the means of production, as workers? Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks. The time during which the labourer works, is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has purchased of him. capitalism is inherently oppressive and disgusting. it is efficient at exploitation. i don't care how much capitalism produces if it is at the expense of exploitation of labourers. if it as the expense of the good working people. *at the expense. why should i labour for another who underpays me for what I have produced to profit for themself? why should the capitalist own the means of production - the machines, the tools with which things are produced - and leave me no power in directing my own labour, or any participation in what I have produced? janet. capitalism is not an inevitability of humanity. well. capitalism developed under a certain set of conditions. and in a certain context, is the thing. most people don't even really understand capitalism. or marxism, or communism. which makes sense, intentional misinformation by the capitalists . no need. what annoys me just is much are people who are like. "leftists are such hypocrites because they dismiss communist failures as "not really being communist"". when like. even the USSR didn't claim to be communist. they're socialist. there's a very specific language/meaning of words here. also what. more like "imagine that you exist in a society where people are divided into social categories and the division of labour corresponds to the division in classes..". "...and you contribute your labour to produce useful cow-related commodities such as milk, beef, leather, etc". "and the class of people who own the means of production - the people who own the milking equipment and farms - buy your labour for a price less than its value and turn a profit". actually i want to correct the cow metaphor now. communism is stalin killing eleventy billion people. weird. nice. mmm. some spicy, sweet bbq beans sound good right now. i saw it. he believes that child porn distribution should be legal. not producing it. but selling the already-existing content, viewing it, sharing it. etc. ...fucked up . it's a religion, i'm pretty sure you can engage in it if you so choose. hi AlexanderPanda. okay, you? oh this looks nice http://inpursuitofmore.com/2016/09/19/pasta-with-creamy-vegan-rose-sauce/. does it count as a flashback if i space out and started heavily reminiscing on things from the past, still being cognizant that i'm living in the present. mmm. i thought flashbacks required like. feeling like you're there. seeing it happen as if it's happening all over again. nevermind. let's stop talking about it. ... no, it's not you. it *is* ridiculous. no, it'll be some complicated historical reference. like a reference to something that happened when Konami got its start. something obscure and ~intellectual~. The voice actor for Bear from Bear in the Big Blue House sounds ever so slightly like David Wain. heh. l-l-l-look at you, amy. a c-c-cute creature of sweetness and trans. how can you challenge a perfect, adorable wuffs. (I'm quoting Shodan, of course). no. "look at you, hacker, a pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you run through my corridors". yeck. hi. heck. are you talking about Lizzy. a trans woman living in South Dakota. trolls showing up on their suicide note. etc. oh...different person then. yeah, her. because people /think/ they killed themself because of kiwifarms but it's not true...and i don't want their memory tarnished. why would they revel in that. i just can't understand it. i wish we were together. i don't ever shave my legs. what are cats. i just realized that my intense isolation/loneliness as a kid was exacerbated by gender norms about who a boy can/can't socialize with to a certain degree. oh, it's ~weird/embarassing~ to make friends with the ~weird girls~ because you gotta be friends with only the girls you could envision yourself dating. plush? 3. Qapla'! <3. i dunno...maybe some sorta foxie, ~. or...a raccoon. or a snow leopard! 3. <- pup. sometimes a fox. generally wuffy. don't wanna be human. //cobbledstories.tumblr.com/post/154680303992/i-had-a-vivid-dream-that-bart-canonically-got-a. 252 seconds). urgent care? are you ok. what happened, . that's good. ??? who was this on fb. that's weird... yeah, just block them maybe? i have no idea. is your fb restricted/lock down to all friends-only, ? ugh. you don't even have naked photos of anyone related to alannah. yeah, i'd recommend locking everything you have down. set your fb everything to be visible to friends-only. etc. :(. I want to be a witch but I don't know that I have the capacity for faith or spirituality or even just to do it because I want to. kinda. why. mmm. in what way. i don't think from what I know of witches, that all witches are interested in those. i think 'witch' is kind of a broad term? i didn't say there AREN'T witches who are into chemistry and pharm. just, i don't think it's a defining necessary feature of a witch. anyway that's kind of irrelevant. idk. something, anything. i have things I'm drawn to and like the idea of bringing magic/ritual into. cooking, coding, cleaning, fire, the moon. but i don't know that I have enough faith to believe in anything beyond the material world or engage in that kind of thing. shrugs. i guess. but I'm talking about like...spells and magic and stuff that most people think of. you know, there are some people who believe/engage in the power of that sort of thing beyond that which science can currently explain. i understand your point, but. I'm just saying it's hard for me to have faith because I've seen no evidence of forces beyond those currently explainable by science. what? i don't understand the question. that would be interesting. I don't know if I'd be disappointed. maybe? I personally don't feel very enraptured or in awe of like, bosons or linear algebra. it doesn't feel magical to me. okay well. i'm talking about me and my particular feelings on the matter. it doesn't feel magical to me and that's causing me distress. it's...it's the idea of cold, unfeeling forces that exist without any sort of spirit or emotion. it's like digging into a bed of rock to find yet more rock and stone, without ever encountg a living, breathing creature. I've wanted to believe in something greater for just about ever. unfortunately I've never had any faith or been able to care about rituals or engaging in 'magic' or ceremony if I didn't believe that i was actually doing anything beyond doing a dance for my own amusement. why pretend to cast spells or whatever if I know it's just fake? why go to church and pray to god, for instance, if I don't actually believe that anyone is listening. this is just me and my experiences. that's not exactly what I mean. if i pray to a being. i only care to engage in that action. if i believe the being exists. for me personally, it would feel worthless otherwise. i'm sorry about that  :(. it's just like...for me, i want to engage in ritual and believe that the ritual is actually doing something. if I'm practicing magic and spells Iwant to believe that...they're actually doing something? . I know. that's just an examoke. *example. if I'm engaging in ritual I want to believe that it's actually doing something other than just satisfying my desire for ritual. because on its own, as solely a gesture of self-satisfaction, it will fail for me. nods. I really want to engage in ritual though. personally, for me. if something does not have a tangible, measurable effect it'll feel worthless to me. if i learn linear algebra I will know something more about the world and can apply it to 3D graphics/shaders. if I code, I can create programs. if I pray or cast a spell...i don't even have faith that anything will happen other than that I did the thing. well, sure, i guess. but you know, there are people who have *faith* that it's doing something. that their prayer will have an effect, that their god(s) actually exist. well, I do envy them. that's what this is about. i want something to have faith in. some higher power. at the very least it might make it easier to get through life. i was always envious of people who developed/had a sensation of a personal relationship between them and their god(s). me too. these links may be relevant to you:. >The paucity of scientific evidence is not a justification to believe whatever one wants. i don't like this line and the approach to faith it implies. i'm not particularly interested in...having science be my end-all-be-all. i want to give in to emotion and feeling moreso than just a scientific approach to analyzing something. not in every matter of my life, but in some. huh? i can only interpret things directly literally. sorry. , what do you mean. i think the American left has some pretty good gains too, many of which have been crushed/held back by the huge US imperialist death machine. i tihnk capitalism does a good job of dividing us, though there often is a lot of bickg over particular points. anyway, AliceMarie. i don't WANT to reject metaphysical causes in favour of operating solely within an understanding of science/scientific method/etc. , such as? which ones? and how is this related to the American left? there have been a lot of politically-oriented people and movements though. the Black Panthers, for one. the IWW. shrugs. Are you saying all this as a reaction to me expressing hurt over spiritual stuff? . because it kind of feels like you're a bit in-my-face about this - i might be misinterpreting, but it *sort* of feels like you're bashing spirituality as a reaction to me discussing my feelings about it. well. sort of, but there was more there. i personally have seen no effect or felt no connection to it. others have. and I envy them and the *emotion* and *feeling* of connection and spirit they have. it wasn't actually intended to be a completely literal "spirituality is garbage objectively" statement. okay, well that's just you. you're being kind of aggressive about it and making me feel bad and it's not helping the feelings I'm feeling. i didn't say it was absurd. can you please back off . it's like if someone of religion X said "man I've been feeling pretty distant from my faith lately" and someone else chimed in with "oh religion is just bogus anyway". if i started saying "I've felt pretty distant from my otherkin identity lately/feeling a connection to that and wish I could feel it as strongly as I have in the past" would you say the same things. morn. sorry. i'm sorry . you have nothing to apologize about. nods. bork. <3. heck. surface area. of what. your entire skin. "only against the Terror Beasts of the hideous Flesh World". borks at . yes~. is the most gorgeousest. you are. if you say that. i just can't understand how people justify capitalism. "capitalism is rsponsible for you having cool things!" even if that was true I'd rather have guaranteed access to necessities than the ability to have loads of shiny crapo. well. i'm not sure I give a fuck about western imperialist governments and their actions. only in the context of being against the shit they pull. what? yes, definitely. there is capitalism. and, tbh. capitalism doesn't really mean "free markets". never has. it's always been about the rich and powerful getting richer and more powerful. about using the power of the state to guarantee their power. well. 'regulations'. capitalism relies upon the state to enforce the system. there are no actual free markets :I. well. smaller gov't means. more direct corporate control. well. riot_grrrl, . it goes back to the Marxist idea of exploitation of surplus value. i mean, the capitalists often make stupid decisions, but there are rules/ideas about this kind of thing. to make a profit, capitalists need to extract a worker's surplus value by purchasing the worker's labour for less than its actual value. which allows the capitalist to make a profit and pay the labourer less than the real value of their labour and expended labour-time. like i said. the capitalists often make stupid decisions. or decisions based in bias. and not pure, utterly rational logic. and efficiency. human bias and human evil. yeah, more or les. *less. well, yeah. also. promoting prejudice among the oppressed allows the capitalists to get the proles to do their policing for them. as LBJ said. "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.". this, apparently (to give context) was him explaining the psychology of racism. not so much offg it as a tactic. http://www.snopes.com/lbj-convince-the-lowest-white-man/. but that's irrelevant. the capitalists love to promote infighting among th proles. yeah. any xenophobe or bigot really. bork. that a cat. doing skype/google hangouts. sleeping together via some video chat service. doing mundane tasks while video chatting - like if you're cooking, just have the other person there on the line. ask a bunch of questions about the other person to get to know them . well, a crime in this system. it's a crime against humanity. yeah. my idea of a fun time is reading agricultural reports for various states. and their respective agricultural output for various crops. https://medium.com/guerrilla-feminism/poly-means-polynesian-not-polyamorous-by-lily-stone-2e401e5338f6#.abcx5ndo0. it sounds more like a very unfortunate accidental coolision than co-opting it. well. yes, I'm quite aware of etymology. but it seems that polyamorous people using the word. has become much more visible. than polynesian people. and if polynesian people feel uncomfortable with 'poly' being seen more as a polyamory thing. than a word to describe themselves, I don't think it's my right to really argue it? the author even suggest polya/polyam. as replacements. the author of that article is a polynesian woman btw. well, maybe not deliberately. but i understand the idea of it being uncomfortable that polyamorous people get visibility while polynesian people's word for themselves is not as visible. poly-amorous people receive much more visibility than poly-nesian people. so, i'm fine switching over to polya or polyam or polyamorous. shrugs. i don't really think it's my right to tell a polynesian person that they shouldn't be uncomfortable with the thing? and i think, to a degree, the "we can use the word too" immediate visceral reaction is at least partially rooted in colonial sentiment. idk. if polynesian people don't like poly being used to refer to polyamory i'm fine switching. listen, i get the etymology thing. what exactly is your core issue with the idea. did polyamorous people literally deliberately steal the word from polynesian people? no, i don't think so. does it speak volumes about colonialism that people feel the need to defend their usage of a word over colonized people of color saying it makes them feel uncomfy? i think so. i've seen this sentiment from other polynesian peopel in other articles. why is it utterly ridiculous. i understand etymology, becca. you could make that reductive argument about ANY word and its etymology. and it often does get made to defend oppressive language. not saying you're doing that. but . what, the prefix 'poly'? okay, and how long have polynesian people been using that term? I don't think it was deliberately appropriated. but I think that poly-amorous people receive infinitely more visibility than poly-nesian people. and maybe we can make that better by allowing polynesian people to own that word and feel comfortable? "i'm not changing because <linguistic argument>" certainly does nothing to make colonized people feel like their concerns are being listened to. yeah, really. i believe that person. i believe that they feel that way. and i believe that it is okay for them to feel that way. you could use polya or polyam instead. language is important, is the thing... i mean, that's just my recommendation. may i ask what exactly is the source of your discomfort over this, becca? what was your hangup? how so? nods. that's okay too...being aro is valid and excellent. nods. wushin, but polya/polyam are short too. Cat, can you rephrase that please? because /pol/ :I. no. sorry. i'm just trying to grok it/understand/parse. yeah, exactly. googles khazar. immediately regrets. i'm sorry for talking about/posting/expressing opinions about the polyamory thing. sorry becca. i feel like you were getting upset with me. well whiteness sucks and is a shitty bad construct. and the assimilation into whiteness isn't a good tihng. well yeah. conditional whiteness and such. no that makes sense i guess. idk sorry. pm? unrelated entirely. sure. Cat definitely. idk i could be wrong, i dunno. mantomanto? partner-partner. :P. byt yiu hyst said manto. you said kunamanto. ""kunamanto" suggests "co-partner" which I think is not quite what metamour means?". oh :PP. :(. ugh. they're awful. sigh. uh who is calling shmorky a pedophile. ....why? ... kiwifarms is honestly making me consider deleting all my social stuff. riot_grrrl you're so smol. well. not just sizewise but connotations. smol is mostly cuteness-related. Naomi? is this a real person or a fictional. fictional, from mgs4. heck. Liebknecht, it's a cattail. they're little reedy plants. i wonder if we could just quiet her. ... my housemate's friend she had over said something that irked me... they were talking about some mutual friend of theirs, a cis guy who is apparently very attractive and sexually skilled and I said "I don't really have any interest whatsoever in doing anything with men". and the housemate's friend said "that's what I thought, too, until I met this guy". i feel like that's a very shitty thing to say. (. bork. 0. heck. well, i think there are certain scenarios were a definitive rule and course of action are necessary. well if someone yells a slur in a channel or is a troll. i think a ban is in order, ja? wel. i interpret things very literally. so i need to establish exactly the bounds of what we're talking about. well. now i'm curious if the way we treated elizzza was not being properly respectful of the way she felt. or leah, etc, etc. you were fine. i don't say that as some devil's advocate thing...i genuinely question myself about that kind of stuff all the time. even if we tried gently to talk to her, tell her it didn't make her a bad person, etc, but that she can still *unintentionally* hurt people on accident. nope. didn't matter. i sort of wish I personally hadn't invested nearly as much emotional labour because it was extremely draining. right, so. the only case where i actually think banning someone would be okay is *if* they're being abusive. and i want to make sure that we don't allow ourselves to be abused by someone abusive just so we can keep giving them chances. well, of course. maybe it's wrong of me to have developed a low tolerance for people engaging in abusive or abusive-seeming behaviours. i think some obvious rules make sense. again, like Fox and amy pointed out. some extremely obvious things nake sense. stuff about slurs, etc. it might seem 'obvious' to some people but I don't much enjoy operating on a premise of obviousness. shrugs. i guess. i think that having some guidelines are good. i don't join channels anymore because i don't feel safe anywhere new online. yeah i think we should type something up to make sure people know it's a place where x and y aren't tolerated. that's okay. this is just me offg some opinions/perspective. <. (i say that because i experience that a lot, being disagreed with and immediately feeling like i need to change my mind to agree with the other perosn). okay. ahhh. yeah. is that narcissa wright. you discuss me. you discussss me. Narcissa's Speedy Running Moving Castle. heck. i get frustrated when i ask a question and someone explains a huge amount of things tangential to the thing i asked about. it feels like someone was just duckflapping at me about something I asked about (how do you determine the weights in a neural network) and explained lots of tangential things over and over again. rather than say "I don't know, it's complicated". "I can't give you that answer". dogs are good. is a dog. yes. it rained. bark, yap, sniff, heck. bork. yeah i can't fathom why anyone who isn't a troll would post that shitty video. biological sex doesn't really exist. what did you have to take away? why did you have to take it away? why did you want her password? maybe you should have a little more faith in your child and allow her privacy. what exactly are you afraid of happening? so what exactly are your "feminist mothg" questions. why does her mother restrict her talking to you? yar, no age is too young for a kid to be afforded privacy and independence. what happened? i do believe it. I just said it. why wouldn't you believe that, yar? i'm not talking complete and total independnece. ah. well, i think that teaching kids that they're allowed to have their own boundaries and that their autonomy is important is something good that we should be doing more of. dies because of what? teaching her that she's allowed to have boundaries and privacy? that is abusive. extremely abusive. who is this that is not letting her pee alone? where is it that you live, solskinn? yar, in the future, please don't imply that i don't really believe something I've just expressed to you. if there's confusion about what I believe it can be clarified but i don't like being told what I do and don't think/feel. i generally try to say what i mean and mean what I say. //medium.com/@FarahKarenina/cultural-appropriation-is-a-toxic-concept-97340ff040e9#.8j7ynia98. i linked the article earlier but i wasn't around to talk about it then, or other people weren't. so i'm going to link it again to see if I can open up a discussion because it's still on my mind . //medium.com/@FarahKarenina/cultural-appropriation-is-a-toxic-concept-97340ff040e9#.nshg3nn4u. I'm pretty sure I disagree. that's my take. like obviously it can be and is misapplied but the same thing holds true of...almost any concept, I believe. cultural appropriation is extremely useful in discussing colonialism IMO. I'm trying to find a thing from Tumblr. //.tumblr.com/post/152735141309/borderlinevamp-trungles#notes. ugh. "feminazis"? in what way do "feminazis" act, pray tell? not for feminism, in what way? like, what do they stand for, in your eyes? what do you define as men being oppressed? I'm quite calm. I'm fairly certain that we've heard all these tired arguments before and they don't really faze us much. it's just boring troll 101 stuff. i'm sorry, but we're not interested in what you're selling. i already bought twelve, thanks. i mean. what are the beliefs of these supposed people. that make it harder for feminism to progress. you've not mentioned anyone concrete. right but where. who, name someone. one person. shadow__, can you name me one of these youtubers, please? name me one YouTuber . just one. or link me a video. i mean. subconscious biases are a thing. all white people are, in fact, socialized to be racist, in western society. sorry, it's a fact. it's just like....how Western society is constructed? Milo doesn't use she/her pronouns, iirc. he or they, IIRC. those are Milo's pronouns. ...and? no one said that. the patriarchy we live in does in fact lead to people being socialized with misogyny. shadow__, Milo uses he/him pronouns or they/them. do not use she/her for Milo again. the institutional prejudice in our society that exists against people who are not men. basically our society exists in such a way which disadvantages nonmen systematically. it's the basis of sexism. that's like. not even true at all. the stereotype is that men are smarter actually, mostly. like, men being more competent. show me those statistics. show me something to back that up. i mean, 55% is not 2 to 1. 55 percent to 45 percent. they sampled this in New England. ah, mirroed the national breakdown. still. 1. have you ever been a woman working in a technical field? if not. you really have no right to talk. because women in say, technology, get talked over sooooooo often. women in many fields, really. being forced to go to war? by whom. deemed smart enough by who. yeah. also, that's a problem with capitalism/imperialism, not like, oppression of men. oppression of men based on their gender, specifically. now you're moving the goalposts again. i think you're just a bad 101 troll who's barely better than a shitty MRA markov chain. mansplaining is a thing. where men talk down to nonmen. it happens all the time. amused, because it's not a thing. amused at how wrong you were. thankee-sai. heh. that person should have known. we're strictly an emacs club. crosses arms like a Radical Cool Kid. i mean. i use sublime text if I'm not doing iOS development. it is what it is. we must do what we can in the meantine. white supremacy is Trump's game. America is a nation of many people. bkeys, as the news of the election sets in, people will come to troll feminist groups. we will see a rise in white nationalism. we need to unite. I recommend all of you install Signal. Signal seems very well received. i do worry that they're just a front to get people to put their sensitive communications there. i get paranoid. basically, at any rate, encrypt yr shit. bkeys, do you understand that a win for Trump is a win for white nationalism? The KKK is overjoyed he's president. I do not think most people who voted for him are white nationalists. I didn't say that. this win will only embolden those who are, tohugh. *though. no. listen. Listen to us. They are becoming vastly emboldened. This is undeniable. This is a serious issue. That cannot be ignored. Hate crimes will increase. Bigotry will increase. Look at all the ones who are, though. It's not about "all trump supporters". it's "the scariest among them". We cannot ignore that. that's not the issue here. That's not what I am talking about. I am talking about the ones who are literal neonazis. Who see Trump as their man. You're not listening to me. In the wake of Brexit, hate crimes increased massively. The same WILL happen here. And we must be ready for it. bkeys, you're just not listening. i'm sorry. the KKK is overjoyed that Trump is President. I would suggest a moratorium on new users for the time being. Shut this channel down. +i only. There will be a lot of trolls coming in, lots of hateful people. My main objection would be that yes the KKK is happy about him being president; but in a world that Clinton won the bankers would of been happy. what abut the bankers? which bankers. The ones who donated to her campaign. trans people, gay people, people of color, disabled people. WILL suffer under Trump in a huge way. I think we should probably set this +I. this channel. lock everything down. I'm so scared all the time lately. I positively cannot believe the people who think that Trump is "keeping LGBT people safe from the radical Islamic terroristS". and not, you know, considg the idea that the biggest threat is from people in the united states? that's the idea. except we might not get the same pinkwashing as Israel. in fact, probably won't. yikes. I can't believe how many Trump supporters fell for the paper tiger of "radical islam" being a threat to people in the United States. "Trump supports gays because he promises to keep you safe from terrorists!" but what about keeping people safe from people in this country who hate queer people....? it's creating a largely imaginary threat. it's a reaction to a largely imaginary threat. now, don't get me wrong, ISIS isn't like, fake. and terror does happen but it's pretty clear that Western intervention in the affairs of other places are largely responsible for so much awful shit. exactly!!!! exactly... it's hilarious (read: scary). Trump supporters are like "we want good jobs, our jobs are shit, we want better lives". not understanding...that capitalism is pretty much the root of all the problems that cause these things. what I wanna know now. is it possible to convince Trump supporters of what they've done? is it even possible, yar. to get these people to understand why we're afraid. why we have valid reasons to be afraid. they think we all love Clinton but that's so laughable. they don't understand that the people who hate queer people are only going to get emboldened. or they refuse to even accept the idea that this might be the case. why have they refused to accept this idea? can we dissuade them from it? I sure wish I had the Point-Of-View gun from the HGTTG movie right now... well, the pov gun literally makes you see it in their perspective in your mind and makes you feel what they feel. which a person on the web can jsut refuse to do. no, not to understand them. I do understand them, to a degree. and feel somewhat guilty that I didn't do...more to provide another alternative outlet to Trump supporter's emotions? like maybe I could have done more. instead of being angry. i dunno... i know that there's probably a lot of other leftists out there who blame themselves. or feel guilty. was it my fault? did i fail humanity . by not being there for more emotional labour. to try and give a different opinion. or lacks tyhe spoons. is tired and exhausted. i tihnk we all need to start listening to RMS more. Richard Stallman. though maybe not. given how awful he is about some things. support the queer people in your life. the gay, trans (Binary and nonbinary), bi, lesbian, pansexualy, polysexual people in your life. support the people of color in your life. support the disabled people in your life. support the muslims in your life. tell them you love them. show them you love them. let them know that they are not alone. support the undocumented immigrants in your life. Who's ESR? RMS is richard Stallman. Richard Stallman has some gross positions like "distributing child porn should be allowed because we shouldn't restrict free information". y'know, the child rapists are bad!!! but the content they produced should be free. i am growing vastly more skeptical of the notion that separatism - ie, women separatism from men - is actually going to be a good idea in our fight against fascism and capitalism. i was talking with an anarchist earlier who refuses to work with any men, or any nonmen who work with men. well, i mean. "work with" in the sense of politics. antifa, etc. i don't think they meant it in terms of labour. hmm...i suppose it can be in certain contexts. like trans-only spaces are good. but by separatism i'm talking more...people who try to separate entirely. well...actually what I'm talking about is white women engaging in separatism from men. which is often racist in its nature. maybe we're not conceptualizing separatism the same way. like, something i encounter on Facebook a lot. there's a subgroup of (overwhelmingly white) trans women who are vehement against CAFAB people. and act like they're the worst people ever and AFAB are so gross and icky. i'm not saying wanting to be distant from, say, men is a bad thing or being wary thereof but it's necessary to analyze things. idk, sorry. "women working with men in rojava are just working towards restoring their masculinity". or "men are inherently violent". i think there's a lot of assumptions we've made, or have been fed, or ideas of humans that have been manufactured, as a result of white supremacy and capitalism. idk. i think most pro-Trump people are going to dismiss any white supremacist acts that occur in the near future as a plot against them. as staged, as fake. oh, absolutely. he wanted to get into the seat. and be in power. and that's pretty much all I think he cared about. I agree with that. but now we need to be careful. we need to be cautious and vigilant. yeah. we cannot guarantee that it won't happen. and we have to be prepared for the possibility that it will. we have to be prepared for MANY possibilities. in the meantime it's a harm-reduction tactic and taking *away* marriage rights isn't any good. in an ideal society there wouldn't be a need for marriage and such. i think if a boat is sinking. it's going to be a clusterfuck no matter what. save as many as you can? . yeah. yeah, defending capitalism. being classist. if you're well-off, not thinking of the implications talking about certain things can have on people who do not have class privilege. I have an awful confession to make. what is it? Anarchocommunism is the ideal for society, yes - but I'm starting to think Maoism is how we get there. The mass line and protracted people's war. basically, you listen to the individual and specific concerns of people in areas, and enhance them with communist theory, and make propositions/action plans that will echo and amplify the concerns of people in those areas and address them. basically, it makes it so that you're not just telling people what to do. you're listening to them and making what *they* want and need work within a communist framework. so that they'll feel more or less like the solutions came from their communities rather than being handed to them by people who might not understand the struggles and concerns of people in those areas. does that make sense? In what you are describing there you are talking about one group who is 'saying what they need' and another group that is 'listening'. What determines which group you are in? nuit, what about the mass line? also, em, basically, if you're in a specific neighborhood in a city, you listen to what the problems are that affect them right there, right then. and figure out how to address those problems in a way that feels useful and organic to them. i'm not exactly sure what stageism is. I wouldn't exactly call myself a maoist really, but I think there are great ideas that can be used . at any rate, I think that people of all anticapitalist variety need to come together now. https://pics.onsizzle.com/h-dont-panic-radicalize-6320400.png. i mean, it's not necessarily? but our feminism is radical, leftist feminism, intersectional. I saw an awesome thing a while back that was kinda funny. "Socialism without feminism is brocialism. Feminism without socialism is Hillary Clinton.". Basically, we need to understand that all of our liberation is NOT just a matter of destroying the patriarchy. We also need to realize that class is such an integral part of this, we need to understand the intersection of class, race, gender, disability, etc. we need to understand that disability is a social construct related to one's ability to produce surplus value for capitalism. yeah...i dunno. i mean like, i dunno how best to defend against the capitalists who might seek to destroy the work of the anti-capitalists. em, i said earlier. it's not necessarily. but there are many many marxist feminists. it's not INHERENTLY a part of feminism. because THIS individual IRC channel is a leftist one. not all feminist spaces are marxist. no, it's okay. under communism will there be restaurants? yeah, but it won't be all about profit. there will still be people who want to cook and share it with others. there will be a lot more like, communal kitchens and stuff. this is an intersectional feminist space. well, i mean, economics/class is certainly a part of thing. what do you mean by an "economic view", though. yeah, like...societal stuff is really important. institutional . institutional things form the basis for a lot of the oppression that exists in this world. and while individual isolated acts aren't unimportant, they don't describe why the world is the way it is. no, i believe there are some men. em, I've mentioned multiple times. communism and feminism are not inherently linked. THIS channel is of the communist/leftist variety. but feminism is not inherently so. yeah. and understanding of class issues/the evil of capitalism is kinda necessary for good feminism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy. maybe because there are people with Dr in their handle? I do not have a PhD, it's just a nickname. I believe drastik is an altered form of the word "drastic". http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drastic. yeah. I don't know if anyone here does. maybe someone does, but I wouldn't know of it. nods. not for profit. there will still be people who want to cook for others and share their culinary art with others. there will be people who come together to cook because they enjoy it. and it will serve the benefit of feeding people, not making people wealthy. i mean, ideally. in practice, maybe. but the idea of working for profit isn't going to be a thing. labour will be self-directed. labour will exist as a means of creating things with use value. people grow food because people need food. people make clothes because they need clothes. absolutely. probably. i mean, computers are a very very *useful* technology. that have revolutionized how things get produced. truth be told, an enormous amount of labour nowadays can be entirely automated. i mean, it's not like we can just transition instantly to Fully Automated Luxury Communism for everyone right away. I mean, I wish we could FALC for everyone. that's a good question. i mean, people today have a relative choice of what they get into. i think we need to eliminate the idea that everyone *needs* to work. there will still be people who want to work. i'm not 100% sure. i mean, capitalism/white supremacy have SO much to do with modern patriarchy. FALC = fully automated luxury communism . here, read this, with regards to questions like "who would do the hard labour". https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/21u7jo/how_can_people_be_expected_to_work_hard_if_they/. https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101. no no no no no no no. never eugenics. malehood/masculinity aren't inherently toxic, imo. the patriarchy is. the patriarchy demands men perform toxic gender roles. yes they are. they are intrinsically flawed modalities. i mean, patriarchal ideals of masculinity are. but I believe firmly that non-patriarchal ideals of manhood and masculinity exist. hell, I have certain masculine traits, as a woman. i think patriarchy-defined masculinity is very toxic. i mean, the gender binary itself is toxic. and we have to remember. that it's Western white supremacy and capitalism that are the sources of the gender binary. many non-Western societies have radically different ideals on gender. eugenics is ALWAYS bad. always. because it ALWAYS disproportionately harms disabled people. queer people. intersex people. etc. yes, VERY racist. well, let me back up for a minute. women don't give birth to men. I mean, yes, kinda, but. people give birth to infants that are then *assigned male at birth*. some of them grow up to identify with/feel comfortable with what they were assigned at birth. and then there are those who do not. i think we need to eliminate assignment of gender at birth. i don't think Western binaristic notions of womanhood are the answer either. or making that the dominant force in society. i think we need to truly, seriously understand the root of all this. which is, Western white supremacist gender binary notions. I'd recommend, em, taking a look at notions of gender outside of Western societies. to understand that the man/woman binary is not something that exists universally, necessarily. em, are you listening to me? so, what I'm saying is. that we need to eliminate patriarchal ideals of masculinity. and the way we assign gender. which addresses the root of the problem, not JUST "protect yourself from men". if we eliminate the /patriarchy/, there won't be anything forcing these toxic masculine *gender roles* on people or coercing them into a toxic performance of gender. all gender, ultimately, is performative. in my opinion. men are not inherently violent, in my view. yes! absolutely. also, remember, em. not every person with a vagina is a woman. and not every person with a penis, is a man. and not everyone can be classified as either a man or a woman. there are people who exist outside of the gender binary. yeah. I think D&D would flourish under communism >_>. all kinds of paper-and-pen roleplaying games, really. I mean, I think it would especially flourish. ywa. yeah. entertainment revolving more around ingenuity and creativity. rather than "buy this to have fun" would probably be much stronger. oh, it's a good thing. I just use >_> a lot as like.... the emotional context implied by the `>_>` emoji, for me, is more...i dunno, hard to explain. but i didn't mean it negatiely. eugenics is never the answer. it will only lead to killing disabled people. queer people. it leads to racial 'purity'. basically, the whole IDEA of genetic 'purity' or being able to create purity through controlling genetics. is disgusting. em, step 1 isn't "change everyone's heart's/minds" though. there's a lot of initial steps. you'd kill trans woman. *women. and lots of intersex people. we here in this channel do NOT. at ALL . support biological essentialist ideals. such as XX = woman, XY = man. the biological sex binary is as much a myth as the gender binary. and is not productive. at all. we don't hate men here or reduce the problem to "men are bad". the source of all ill in this world is NOT men. we don't support such reductive notions. yep. it's very reductive and doesn't get at the root of the problem. yep. the patriarchy WANTS people to think men are violent. it's self-justification. the patriarchy socializes men to be violent. impresses these roles upon them. coerces them into behaving in this way. it is not some inherent characteristic to men. em, are you listening? yeah, exactly. yeah, but they might still be listening. you stand correct. Drastik is indeed drastic with a k instead of a c (i hope you can see this). i can. i did not, no. I just am able to see your message. you could probably do publicly? what are your rules-related problems. nothing specific i don't think, but the trump election didn't help. mcpro, what do you mean. any hypotheses on what the patriarchy did specifically? sent in from the patriarchy? in what way. like, from where specifically? many of the trolls who come here are quite clever/intelligent. it's their bias and misogyny that's the problem. it's a societal structure. more like an abstract that exists in society. as opposed to one clear definite institution. is there something inherently wrong about being on the left? "virtue signaling" seems mostly like an alt-right terminology to decry people with specific values. "oh you're just posturing to impress your SJW cuck friends". kind of thing. alt-right is white nationalists and neonazis. mostly. why would you be interested in an alt-right channel. like, its really useful to understand why people see the world otherwise than you. I understand WHY they see the world otherwise, to a degree. but too much emphasis on "understanding" people like that is dangerous. it's better to defend against nazis than try to understand them. they don't care about/want your understanding. they want you, your disabled comrades, your black comrades, dead. they want your queer comrades dead. "I want to ensure a safe society for everyone where there is no bigotry". yeah wow such an awful thing to be >_>. honesty would be really nice. I'm really uninterested in understanding nazis. i mean like, maybe convincing proto-nazis away from going full-on? if i see someone heading down that road, yeah. how are you going to convice them that are wrong then? i dunno. none of us want you here, sorry. we don't want nazi sympathizers in here sorry. when did I say that I was a nazi sympathizer ? you didn't. we just wanna make sure people aren't. we get a lot of trolls. people come in here and brigade all the time. and harass. sigh. the Unicode value representing the hammer and sickle is U+262D, just sayin'. liberation would be tearing down the fence altogether. well, i mean. not everyone wants to play baseball. but i get what you mean. yar, sorry. oh. i don't pick up on tone well. yar, statements of the form "ok fine do whatever you want" are often used, in spoken speech, to indicate exasperation/passive-aggression. not saying you did that. or meant it that way, but it can be interpreted that way. so I thought I annoyed you . or for example, public places assume everyone can walk unassisted/without a cane or wheelchair. yep. yeah. government violations? such as...? IMP_42, i don't think so. oh, government violations in terms of like, not providing accessibility. well...sadly a law can exist but no one can give a heck about it. and it just doesn't get enforced. so so so so so many ADA violations and no one even cares. i mean, these are all examples of things that happen. i wasn't talking about anything specific I personally have experienced. the NYC subway system has so few elevators. no one cares, really. to fix it. buildings without wheelchair access. politicians don't really care, sadly. look at the UK. i'm saying even if they do. look at the UK and people having disability benefits slashed. what is the due diligence of civic duties? it sucks. disabled people are so heavily disadvantaged in this world. what. ...what? what does that have to do with anything. the sociobiology thing. i mean. even if there is willingness and action. sometimes you get steamrolled over, ignored, hell even jailed. jail is not an excuse? wut. it's not an excuse for what. yeah. band-aid . doesn't address root cause. could be useful as a harm-reduction tool? but idk. what's it about. nods. can i complain about a technology. why is addrlen a parameter to the bind() function if you could theoretically just get the my_addr->ai_addrlen from the sockaddr you pass into the function. what do you mean. whoever wrote the bind() function could just dereference the address length from the pointer to the sockaddr that got passed in. and I'm pretty sure that you can pass in either a sockaddr_in or sockaddr_in6 to bind() as the my_addr param. i think you can just cast between them easily. at least, that's how I see it? i could be thinking about it wrong. I dunno how bind() is implemented. i mean, though. there are people who don't identify as human, genuinely. and i think that's valid. it's generally very easy to know when someone is trolling. yeah. kinda cautious about who. me? or IMP_42. oh, right. yeah... 11-dimensional gender space. extra dimensions folded at the quantum level. err, extra genders folded at the quantum level. I had a lamb gyro a few hours ago. should I eat more. creepy. very creepy. she told you that you were worthless? that's abuse. that's abuse. yeah. it's not always an absolute. but the likelihood of experience/status imbalance makes it...a tentative thing. abuse can happen to anyone. and come from anyone. regardless of gender. sorry. it happens. busy people. well, there's trolls all the time, really. has something happened? we don't know what specifically you are experiencing. could you tell us more? trouble in what way? as in, you faced discrimination/bigotry? yeah...being trans is hard. well, first let. first let's ask. what do you think about people with Down's syndrome? and? what do you think about their right to exist. their rights in general. do you think their disability means they shouldn't have a right to exist? ah, okay. so what would the advantage of aborting a fetus with a detectable disability be? what do you think might cause a person to not want a disabled child? what do you think might cause it to be more than they can handle? vaesper, because I'm trying to get at something. and trying out the socratic method rather than just talking at you. i personally think it's *very* relevant to examine what might cause a disability to be more than potential parents can handle. in fact, I think the prime reason is that society is not very friendly to disabled people. and does not like to provide the necessary accommodations. also, disabled people are seen as lesser. now, this isn't to say, abrogate the rights of someone seeking an abortion. but it's good to examine what might cause someone to not want a disabled child, imo. i think that rather than simply say whether or not a person should be allowed to seek such an abortion. we should examine why and whether or not those societal attitudes need changing. what would your opinion be of a white person who wanted an abortion because their child would be black? to prevent them from being born with Down's syndrome? i don't see the value in eliminating people with Down's syndrome. what if we changed our societal attitudes and did not see them as lesser, or burdens? well then, why not work towards that? i think that's a much better solution than "eliminate disabled people from the population". i think so, yeah. nothing is inevitable. i mean, that's why it's a thing to be worked towards. work towards it to bring it closer. i think eliminating people with Down's syndrome from the population is about as useful (by which I mean, not useful at all) and equally as horrific as trying to eliminate any attribute. like genetically modifying people not to be black. i think it would be wrong to genetically modify children, especially in current society. eugenics is a hell of an awful thing. .... the metric sucks. ...what? i suppose. strive for progress? define "progress". what sort of progress? progress of what nature? well. I don't think that's an inherent tendency of human society. i think that's something that exists due to capitalism. do you have any evidence this is something inherent to humanity? i don't think I have the energy for this convo, sorry. define endowment bias. capitalism as we understand it today, also, is only really an invention of the past...oh, 300-ish years? . i mean, 'meritocracy' in its current form/the idea of it has a lot of problems. especially since the idea of the "most fit" person for a position has little to do with their performance. and if it does, it ignores the idea of societal factors that might disable a person. "from each according to their ability, to each according to their need" is a pretty good system. I mean, I think production should be self-managed and for individual use. rather than for creating surplus value for, say, capitalists. you work/produce things of value, not things for profit. i mean, surplus things of value, sure. enough grain to last the winter, extra tools in case you need them. but that's different than what I'm talking about. wolves kill sheep to eat them. because wolves need meat to survive. they do? do you have like. sources on wolf behavior . on some notion of just a mad, uncontrolled killing frenzy? because that doesn't sound like how most predators act. can you provide any evidence that wolves behave this way. no, I can't, because I was unaware canids behaved this way. I mean, I think humans are extremely biased against wolves. given that wolves impact herds/profit/etc. such that humans have driven wolves to the brink of extinction. other predators, too. i mean, we have to first establish whether or not that behaviour exists in wolves. there's a LOT of stereotypes/misinformation about wolves out there. so if your analogy isn't even true in the natural world. then it's not very applicable to humans. //www.outsideonline.com/2066881/truth-about-wolf-surplus-killing-survival-not-sport. most of the articles I'm seeing on this show that wolves kill large numbers as a means of surplus. literally surplus food. not sport or "not knowing what to do with the prey" but literally as a means of having extra food for a winter. You've yet to prove that this is even a real thing wolves do. okay. well, rather than some rando's opinion on canid behaviour, maybe we can find some expert analysis on this. Also this article made me laugh with one of the lines. //missoulian.com/news/local/wolves-kill-sheep-at-ranch-near-dillon/article_5ff01772-938f-11de-9aca-001cc4c03286.html ""My bucks were on private ground, in a pasture where we've been pasturing them for 50 years. The wolves were intruders that were in the wrong place," he said.". >wolves. >intruders. also, just because certain canids do it, doesn't mean necessarily it's applicable to humans. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_killing. okay, so it appears to be a thing. i really don't think that it's necessarily accurate to apply the concept to humans. I didn't say you were. I don't think you are. I just don't see the point of this . i mean, yes, humans have cognitive bias. oh, is this a big analogy for "cognitive bias might once have served a purpose in the past" rather than necessarily about surplus killing itself? what is your point. can you condense it into one, easy sentence please. to which society? human society? I don't think so, given that capitalism is EXTREMELY Western in nature. yes, Russia/China were socialist states. what of it? what's your point. well, why do you think it failed miserably? do you think maybe that extreme Western/capitalist opposition to it might have been a thing. and years of capitalists spreading propaganda. and doing whatever possible to stop workers from exercising their rights. and prevent the system? because honestly. I think that might be a big pat. *part. communism cannot be seen to have failed entirely under its own weight. it was, in large part, killed. i don't think 'biological programming', also, is necessarily somehow all that powerful. i mean, maybe not as powerful as you think, is what I'm saying. i mean, it's possible. but i don't think it's as important as doing the right thing. IMP_42, what's your area of expertise/line of work. I'm just saying that I don't think even many neuroscientists are all that convinced on how the brain/biology/mind etc work. so i think to a degree, it's not useful to spend too much time philosophizing about. and to instead just figure out what actually should be *done*. it depends on what "human nature" is. and i think the idea of 'human nature', some inherent thing. is largely silly. people have claimed that almost everything under the sun is 'human nature'. and humans act in so many distinct and different ways. it. it's human nature for men to rape women, for instance. i mean, i'm not claiming that it IS human nature. just, that people *claim* that it is. are you talking about a specific bias or a generic concept of a bias. also, do you like, see any value in actually *advocating* for any useful social changes? or is it all lofty and theoretical for you. well, i mean. do you actually believe in any specific social changes? or is it all a matter of "forming an opinion" to you? like, what's your opinion on Nazis. i mean, to me, there's a certain point where forming an opinion is less important that, say. advocating for the rights and lives of fellow people. i mean, your opinion on like, dealing with them. is it all just theory and opinions? because white nationalists want to literally kill people of color and muslims. and i don't really care about the theory behind them. and instead would like to stop them. do you think that murdg Jews simply for being Jewish is wrong? i didn't say killing people was always bad. i'm talking about people who want to murder black people and Muslims simply for who they are. would you stop that, if you could? would you stop a neo-nazi from killing a gay person out of hatred? yes or no. if you could. is that sarcasm? oh, okay. i don't detect sarcasm very well and get a lot of 'false positives'. why is that such a hard question? if you could prevent neo-nazis from massacring a bunch of Jewish people, would you? see, because, i'm a big believer in enacting real solutions rather than discussing the theory of things. there need to be immediate responses to problems like this. i think that understanding them is the lesser of priorities. building defenses comes first. no. why? i mean, the problem is that to a degree I DO understand it. which is? like, not giving scholarships to anyone who's black? why would you not give assistance to people who are at a social disadvantage? huh? who is using skin color as an arbitrary way to define minority. i think elky is using 'minority' in a generic sense. to mean 'marginalized minority' in the sense of a literal minority. as in, transgender people make up 1%ish of the population. a literal minority. in the united states, black people really are largely economically disadvantaged. i mean, they definitely are. i mean, the idea isn't to focus on one thing, the idea is to recognize the intersection of race and class. it's not like fighting racism means we don't also fight classism. and predation on the working people by the capitalists. rescind means "to take back". elky, I'm not sure if they do. i'm hesitant to assume what people do/do not know. I mean, ethnic conflict within Africa occurs. like, the Rwandan genocide. yeah. what was the last you saw. The last I saw was "elky dies laughing". prepare for the worst, is my advice. regardless of what happens, have a plan. have a plan that takes the worst outcome into account as a possibility. I'd say, prepare for drastic. even if it doesn't happen. you'll be better prepared. are you listening to me? my advice is "prepare for the worst even if it doesn't come to pass". there's NO harm in being prepared. what would you do if he DID screw up the H1B system? do you have a plan in place? it's making up for lost time. it's helping to bring a disadvantaged population to the same level. i mean, it's not like scholarships for merit don't already exist. or financial aid for those who need it. it's not "only give financial assistance to black people going to college", which the alt-right would have you believe. literally the alt-right would try to convince you that white people are oppressed and that Jews and black people rule the country with an iron fist of feminism and political correctness. and will engage in rampant miscegenation and sully their white women, while at the same time decrying people of color for being lazy and all on welfare. none of that is true, of course. that's basically literally what's happening in the US, IMP_42. white people built an empire in this country via the labour of people of color, literal slaves, and then spent decades trying to keep them down. and still do. IMP_42, no one is saying "only provide justice to black people". or "only black people should be helped from a position of economic disadvantage" but it's important to realize what's actually going on in society. it's crucial to understanding the actual reality of things. racism exists. it is indeed because people of color face more bullshit. black people suffer from hundreds of years of slavery and then many more decades spent trying to literally keep them down. and oppressed. deny their voting rights, enforce segregation. stereotype them as criminals and thugs. assassinate political leaders fighting for justice. this has been going on for so many years. i'd say black people suffer from white supremacy. plain and simple. i can't hear what IMP_42 is saying. is it some white nonsense. i mean. did u even read the rules. this sorta thing happens. i mean, just because someone said "yeah you can talk about intersectional stuff" doesn't mean it's carte blanche to talk about /whatever/. obviously there's. nuance and situational stuff. if I said "hey can I talk about historical figures" and someone said "yes", it would be abusing that to talk at great length and in morbid detail about famous serial killers/child abusers. what the heck is up with this "virtue signaling" altright doublethink. hey so remember when black americans built their own institutions and businesses and strong communities and kept police brutality out and the US government waged war on them because of that. fucking remember that. what are you femopsing? to be clear, that's not me agreeing with it, that was me being bitter at the brutality of the US government and how shite it is and how racist this shithole of a country is. /. don't forget the US concerned citizens and common folk who were involved. hackunoichi, "!femops" is a command to summon the operators of this channel. it's basically like calling "moderators! come quick, something that requires your attention is occurring". ah ok ! ). in the US, not as much. depends on the insurance. usually. sometimes not. yeah, no. hah. insurance costs out of pocket can be upwards of $300 a month. and if you make over a certain amount of money and don't have insurance. you get fined. and companies are not obligated to provide insurance to their workers. if you're poor enough you can get free health insurance but the fascists are gonna blow that up. vaesper, it's not about euphemisms. "sex worker" is much more literal and direct. "prostitute" has a lot of aggressive connotations. and a lot of demeaning connotations. it's not a dirty word. it's a descriptor of like, a literal type of sex work. terminology. every sex worker I've ever spoken to. //www.thenation.com/article/lets-call-sex-work-what-it-work/. "prostitution" has such connotations of like...implying sex workers are all these poor abused souls who are trapped in some kind of hell who need to be rescued. like they're all trafficking victims and such. trying to convince yourself in what capacity? I don't understand the relevance. did you even read it? i mean. sex work is work. no matter what, and we're not swerfy here. //www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/thinking-of-sex-work-as-work/283843/. i mean, what do you mean by that, though? in what way do we take the cultural context of the us as the go-to standard. other than me linking to a website whose url I didn't even pay attention to tbh. literally every sex worker I've ever known prefers this terminology. and what we're saying. vaesper, what's your dog in this fight. that's an expression that means "why are you pressing this issue". is it just discomfort with being asked not to use the word "prostitute"? under attack in what way? you were asked not to use a specific terminology and then fought it. why? louiz? vaesper, she's an op. vaesper, you were asked not to use a term and provided an explanation. vaesper, that's why. we provided you the info. by swallowing your damn pride. it's a fucking internet chatroom. distract yrself. sometimes you'll end up feeling uncomfortable in the course of learning stuff. . sorry. feeling uncomfortable is a necessary part of learning, sometimes. I'm sorry if I'm on edge, just, you know, fascists controlling the damn white house and whatnot. so I'm prone to be snippy. well, i mean, work is currently necessary to procure the resources necessary to survive, hackunoichi. would you say that about other slurs, too? if you can't accept the idea of it, is the thing. In french, work is a creation of money and capitalism. To produce is not to work. I don’t know in English. well, i mean, labour existed before capitalism. but i see what you mean, sorta. yeah. there is a difference between "work" and "labour", i think. i don't mind performing some useful or pleasurable labour. yreah. i'm agreeing with you, hackunoichi. all work is exploitative. i don't think that's at all what she was saying. yeah, this isn't just us-centric. sex work is work no matter where it is being performed, and the notion of "prostitution" and the language around it. is used to demean sex workers. and portray it in a certain light. well, see. Trump basically just lies and does whatever he wants for power. he's a fascist. it's productive to the aim of drumming up populist support. they don't actually care about "being productive". or justice or working together. Trump just wants to be the man in the high castle. welcome to the cyberpunk dystopia. yr basically a character in a shadowrun game at this point. kristina, it's because there's no need/reason for Trump to actually be honest. his entire campaign was built on lies. yep. it's part of the america first thing. it's gross. it's nationalism and xenophobia. xenophobia is gross. kristina, because he's a fascist. I'm growing even more disillusioned by liberals than I thought possible. I thought I was at Total Disillusionment™. what happened? Oh, the whole "building defenses against fascism/denying fascists their freedom of speech makes you just as bad". how to deal with it? just action for what we believe in i suppose. I dunno. some liberals might be convinced. some can be swung over. but i think it's less important to spend time convincing and more important to build defenses. ah the classic anti-antifa rhetoric. yeah, anti-antifa. antifa = antifascism. anti-antifa = liberals who get uncomfortable with direct action against fascism because they're uncomfortable with challenges to the status quo. and think that beating up nazis is mean. remember that it is a sacred responsibility to beat up any fascists or nazis you see. it's just kyriarchy again. welcome to white supremacist america. I propose that we bring back the black panthers. I think black militant communists ready to fuck up nazis are exactly what this society needs. there's a church near my apartment with a sign that says "Trump is a rapist, racist con man". sigh. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-Point_Program. i think i have a few right angles, so no. i'm not a round. (that's a play on words). yeah, cis feminism often sucks. lots of places. TERF spaces. any feminists who don't think transgender women are women. there are many different types of modern day feminism. hm? talking bathrooms. also oh boy thank you Amtrak Wifi for dropping literally all of my packets now and forever. what about washrooms? i don't really have a choice, Defcronyke. not my network. what do you mean. like, this is literally not an internet connection I personally am paying for. I'm not at my house. so I have no control over i. it. rooted in what sense? what exactly is the problem. i don't love Time Warner, don't get me wrong. why? also, even at my apartment back home, Time Warner is pretty much the only option. sad to say. follow who/pm who? is that what 'we' is referring to in that context? ah. yeah, NYC doesn't have an enormous amount of internet options sadly. i mean, I don't really have the option of doing that right now? i am fully aware. I've lived there for years. careful of what specifically? yeah. i'll be fine, relatively. I'm a software developer. the culture of it kind of sucks, tbh. but i like what I do, i like technology. i just don't care for startup culture, tech culture, etc. i like technology and learning and innovating and growing but I could not care less about venture capitalists and any of that bullshit. i code because computers are fascinating; the money/job aspect just allows me to feed myself, basically. and enjoy a relatively comfortable life. oyakodon is yummy. first time making it and it came out pretty well. why in the heck is there so much fearmongg about nuclear power. why the heck do white people act like they deserve brownie points for stopping doing things that were awful that were going on. context? oh just reminiscing on people I've seen like. acting like it's a credit towards white people for ending slavery in the US. or for giving rights that people should have had in the first place. what exactly causes a person to believe that Islam is some extremist violent hateful ideology. sigh. lack of critical thinking about what? mmm. sigh. i'm terrified of queer people in the US being sent to death camps. probably won't happen - probably will just be, remove all your protections and such - but I fear it nonetheless. no, i meant just all queer people in the US. i dunno if it's a rational fear. I get lots of irrational paranoias. i mean, I know. but I'm afraid that it's inevitable. that it's what'll happen. why much less so? i envy you. Defcronyke can i ask you a question. //www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/23/291525991/when-vanilla-was-brown-and-how-we-came-to-see-it-as-white. fascinating stuff. "the end of Nazis not feeling validated in their white supremacy and the beginning of them thinking that they can do whatever they want and fuck whoever doesn't like it". the "alt-right" are just white supremacists. that's all they are. fucking Nazis. wut. "actually, communists caused nazis". ohhh of course. I was just about to ask. "i hope you're not perpetuating that goddang Nazi holodomor myth". was there a famine? yeah, weather happens, Stalin can't scream at the clouds to make them do his bidding. you also have to consider that many kulaks burned their fields rather than submit to collectivization, because of course the wealthy landowners are gonna be salty. was there bureaucracy and mismanagement? yeah, in any system there is. i don't think Stalin was good but I think we need to take some of the more outlandish Western imperialist propaganda about communist states in stride . well, no, true, but the point stands. refutation of what? fascism is one of the two ideologies of capitalism. the other being liberalism. capitalism itself gives rise to fascism. liberal capitalist society produces the social climate for fascism to rise. because liberal capitalist societies are fucked, yo. but it's important to understand that liberalism and fascism are two sides of the same coin. no, classical liberalism. in the leftist sense. not "democrats" vs "republicans" or any silly such thing. free market capitalism, economic "freedom". yeah, it's gross stuff . neoliberalism is choking this planet and its people. and creating the conditions necessary for fascism to rise. howso? what's yr local political system? mmm. find out who yr local leftists are. most Finns speak English, I thought? . idk, Finnish craigslist. P. Well, i mean, find the actual people themselves. talk to them. i think kirjatoukka is also a Finn. oh. jesus Christ. jeff sessions made a speech back in 2000 fearmongg about how special ed students were basically getting away with everything and not being punished. how disabled kids are basically raping and assaulting people and nothing is being done because of accommodations. it's like do these people even care about sounding remotely accurate with how the world works. //www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/floor-statements?ID=a7977b1d-7e9c-9af9-753e-8f3a8b3b43fb. what exactly do you think we will be able to do to alleviate yr boredom. do you know what this channel is for and why. Defcronyke? also hi again. what do you mean "too meta". also can i ask a weird question. i was talking to Defcronyke. I was asking them if i could ask THEM a weird question. what do you mean by that, jccss-jeremy? "jccss-jeremy" is the realname when i look at it. i do not see what you are seeing, yar. oh wait is jccss-jeremy also Defcronkyke? . Defcronyke. someone please tell me in literal terms what is going on. because I am confused. And not getting it and telling me "look at X" is not going to help me understand the implications. yar, elky, please elaborate? freenode doesn't really mandate what we have to talk about here. to the best of my knowledge. why would we have to stay off topic? we can talk about feminism here if we want. and we do all the time. there are no rules about this dictating things that we follow. we've never even heard of any of these 'rules'. no, it's just a temperature system. widely used . Defcronyke do you know what plurality is. it's definitely real. required to achieve fairness? how was it fucking with y'all. why weren't things fair. plurality is hard. is what yar said correct, Defcronyke. may i ask why? huh? disparity howso. 'superficial versions'? well, you can accuse someone of being -ist and that doesn't necessarily make it true. hm? i'm not following. ah. for all of society. it's kind of inescapable. society itself is racist. //www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5fx6hw/born_rich_2003_jamie_johnson_johnson_johnson/. that's sarcasm. I want to make a hat that says "Make Syracuse Haudenosaunee Again". Syracuse is a city in Upstate NY and was inhabited pre-Europeans by the Onondaga nation. the Onondaga were a constituent of the Haudenosaunee, known to Europeans as the "Iroquois". A confederacy of several nations. basically as a pushback against this white supremacist nation we live in. mmm, I wonder if I could do that for like Cafepress or something. donate all funds to Standing Rock. huh? what do you mean. when I said "basically as a pushback against this white supremacist nation we live in" I meant "I have the desire to make this hat because I want to pushback against this white supremacist nation, the United States of America". not "the Haudenosaunee were formed as a pushback against a white supremacist nation". where are you from. ah. cool, I live in NYC too. Harlem. /. oh nice. is where i'm from. yeah, Green Lake is a meromictic lake. which means that there's no seasonal intermingling . the layers of water between the surface and deep do not mix. //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meromictic_lake. it's a very deep lake for its surface area. it's beautiful but going there always freaked me out because of the basically vertical drop-off in some areas, just a few feet from the shore. i have a very bad fear of deep water. green lake reaches a maximum depth of 195 feet. Seneca Lake is deeper though, 618 feet. i hate liberals. let's hope you're also talking about "liberals" in the leftist sense. not the "liberal/conservative" dichotomy that is itself a liberal dichotomy. guh. liberals. ). 260 seconds). hi. i dreamt last night that all or part of the united states (dunno whihc, it was a dream) became a socialist state. howdy Roxie. welcome . not all of us are ladies here. shrugs. just saiyan. yeah. We offer a wide selection of Premium Genders™ here. defend Trans Girl Premium Gender™ at all cost. well, i mean. we're super pro-trans liberation. Trump replaces all the members of the Supreme Court with the Skeksis from Dark Crystal. Supreme Court trials are now resolved with Trial By Stone. please get me out of here ;-;. (. ypu. you've already got a bunch of fairies, . you're dating them <3. i don't think it needs to. pfft. nice. oh boy. white dutch people getting 'uncomfortable' at discussions of the racism of Zwarte Piet. really make me feel something strong. hm? what do you mean. oh man zwarte piet is such a shitshow every year. yeah probably. well. i mean, Zwarte Piet is a racist fucking travesty of a tradition. well i mean. this is what I've been hearing from Dutch people of color . so . shrugs. they seem to be in agreement that it's pretty fucking racist??? and pretty goddamn awful. i mean from an objective standpoint the blackface sucks. well, from some abstract analysis of the situation sure. but i mean, would you say black slavery is objectively racist. okay, what's your definition of it then. because by "object" I mean "represents the material reality of the way things actually are". s/object/objective. i mean, i guess anything is. but i'm not going to give credence to that whole thing when we're talking about like. nazis, etc. or racist Dutch politicians. but yeah, let's move on from some abstract philosophical fuckery. because it's useless in actually talking about this issue at this point in time. i mean from the way racists talk about it, hattusili_III. literally anything less than the Holocaust or slavery, is racism. err. literally anything less than the Holocaust or slavery, *CANNOT* be considered racism, in their eyes. or the people who say that "There's no sexism in the West" because their definition of 'sexism' is like...idk, women being stoned to death for adultery. i mean, blackface itself is racist. if sinterklaas had little magical helpers that would be fine i think. but he has helpers who are literally portrayed by white people in blackface. i mean, European society is really damn racist is the problem. white europeans as a whole. are you familiar with how religions absorb other religions? it depends on the religion i guess? it seems an overly broad question so maybe just say what you're thinking of. ah, i see what you mean. well. maybe. i mean, definitely with the no blackface thing. i personally don't care about Sinterklaas having magical helpers. Santa Claus has his elves . i really don't give a heck about the Sinterklaas tradition as a whole *except* for the fact that it has racist elements that white dutch people will, on average, explode on you if you suggest it's racist. from what I've seen and heard, at least. http://qz.com/307305/the-dutch-dont-think-its-racist-for-santa-to-have-black-slaves/. i'm just struck by the line: “It’s deeply, deeply sad,” commented Dutch prime minister Marke Rutte. “You can’t disturb a children’s party like that.”. i'm trying to think of anything analogous in the US. oh, i think the Confederate flag is definitely comparable in some ways. "don't deny our heritage and tradition" kind of thing. lots of people got uppity over the Mall of America here in the states hiring a black santa. vaesper, they don't want to explain to their kids that white people AREN'T actually the superior race. it may not be a conscious decision. but it's how white people in the West are socialized. http://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/santa-is-white-boycott-mall-of-america-online-racists-are-having-a-meltdown-over-malls-black-santa/. their nostalgia for when they didn't have to admit that black people existed and are people. severe tangent: the first Dutch horror movie is a hilarious shitshow of a film. have you seen De Lift, vaesper. well i recommend you watch this simply for the "so bad it's good" angle. i just realized. in the Rankin-Bass film of the Little Drummer Boy, the greedy villain character is extremely heavily coded with Jewish stereotypes. and the only other character who isn't some nondescript vaguely-white puppet is one of the Magi - Balthazar, I think. i think ableism is EXTREMELY related to feminism, enchi. especially because bullshit liberal white feminism historically has been willing to fuck over disabled women for its own gains. well, this is an intersectional feminist space. and i think discussing the many intersecting systems of oppression is always on-topic. besides, there is a non-zero amount of disabled people in this channel, myself included among that quantity. oh, i don't think you would be. yeah! I'm of the opinion that discussing any of the following should never be considered off-topic here: racism, ableism, ageism, the evils of capitalism, Marxism, etc. it's even in the rules:. "This chat room’s aim towards this subject is to create a class-conscious speech. Readers will note that speech has a class character, and that socialist feminists are against bourgeois speech. The aim of this space is to create an environment that promotes continuous discussion that accretes theory and knowledge.". well, i mean, our intersectionality/material basis is reflected in the rules, at least. but yeah, both actions and words are important. it's great if a space doesn't allow you to use ableist slurs but refuses to accommodate for autistic people with regards to sensory concerns. for example. yes. sorry, that was poorly phrased. it was meant along the lines of..."it's all well and good if someone does X thing to combat ableism but it kind of becomes jack shit if you refuse to take actions beyond changing speech patterns". for one, an autistic conference where journalists were asked not to use flash photography because of epileptic panelists. and a journalist used flash photography anyway. and my friend ended up chucking a pen at him. i don't even know. yeah, not in a deliberate way but more like. by 'deliberate' here i mean 'not in a way deliberately intended to cause harm' but that doesn't matter much. here, let me find a link to the incident. https://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2015/09/so-much-for-we-learned-from-our-errors.html. oh, it wasn't a journalist. https://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2016/04/i-know-why-your-child-acts-out.html. or maybe those were unrelated people. anyway, even conferences FOR AUTISTIC PEOPLE have trouble like. granting access needs? it sounds like that conference was for autism moms, tbqh. well, yeah. but i mean. like, actually being accommodating. yeah anything where allistics are involved. is gonna end up sucking for autistics somehow. allergy parents? what characterizes an allergy parent, elky. "autism parents" are a whooooole other ballgame. different sport, even. even the slightly-more supportive autism parents are...fucking terrible. yep! when i call up and ask about allergy accomodations and the person on the other end describes how they're an allergy parent and how they eat the same thing as their kid out of support then describe how they regularly eat at their work and suggest a thing with allergen in it. Autism Speaks released a video featuring a woman who was talking about how much she fantasized about engaging in murder-suicide with her autistic daughter. WHILE her daughter was in the room. saying that the only reason she didn't, was because of her allistic daughter. to autism parents, autistic people are seen as barely deserving of life? we're viewed as burdens who are best put out of our misery...or freaks with something wrong with us... our issues are often discussed in the context of our parents/allistic relatives and how much THEY see US as burdens... because doing nothing but being devoted to intellectual pursuits - in that you have your own emotions and struggles - means you're being autistic Wrong, sweetie. don't you remember? </sarcasm>. sigh, i remember being accused of being "emotionally ret*rded" by my parents. not the only context in which they swung the r-word... they'd yell at me how "even ret*rds can do this/understand this" and wondg why I wasn't able to. tbqh i have an extreme distrust for neurotypical parents of autistic people...if they're allistic but otherwise neurodivergent it's a little better, but... yep. so yeah, . you'd say ableism is a feminist issue, aye? ayup. feminism should always center the most marginalized people in its efforts. disabled women, women of color, trans women. especially when all those intersect. ayyup. indigenous women... personally i think feminism is worthless without incorporating Marxism and without dialectical materialism. "why should black men, who are basically subhuman animals in ADDITION to being men, have any equal standing with white women" is something some well-known suffragette said. yep here it is. //the-toast.net/2014/04/21/suffragettes-sucked-white-supremacy-womens-rights/. white suffragettes can fuck off. i should look into NYC wobblies. nice. //pro.politifake.org/image/political/1103/capitalism-socialism-and-communism-spelled-out-in-their-pros-political-poster-1299682478.jpg. wow nice analysis there. i feel weird because my Maoist friend has introduced me to many precepts of Maoism and...i think even an anarchist would do well to understand Maoist theory. there's a lot of value there. yeah. i think the mass line and protracted people's war are good concepts. but you see riddim. Deng was right all along, actually </sarcasm>. //i.imgur.com/6uJzf4x.jpg. i find that third worldists often seem to...hmm, how should i say...many of the twists i've encountered are like..."you can't complain about the hardships you face in amerikkka because the third world has it infinitely worse". yeah. sigh. i hope with Comrade Fidel's death the good people of Cuba will be able to continue to resist imperialism. i dunno if that'll happen, though... but you know, Cuban refugees in the United states *totally not rich batista bourgeois fuckers cough cough* like Ted Cruz are right about the brutality of the Cuban regime /s. i want the Black Panthers back. what about them, fluttrshy. apologists in what respect. to say nothing of actual, factual brutality that has been committed by socialist states, i think we must consider strongly the possibility that at least some of the reports of mass murder/atrocities. are capitalist propaganda. they deny the intentional mass starvation of millions of Ukrainian farmers. i certainly think a famine occurred but it's not like Stalin yelled at the weather to make that be the case. i think at the worst, there was bureaucratic mismanagement during the Holodomor. there's a large amount of actual evidence that the Holodomor was not intentional. i think we have to at least CONSIDER the possibility that what we have been told could be tainted with capitalist propaganda. and seek the truth of the matter with the knowledge in our heads that what we have been told could very well be lies. and from what I've investigated, it seems that at least some of it is. absolutely. i will not deny things that the Soviet Union did that were shitty. or atrocities. well, it was a socialist state, so by definition it's not communism. socialism is a transitory period . vanguard party and whatnot. communism is stateless and classless . but yeah, i think that a LOT of what we've been told about socialist states is propaganda. just like everything we've been told about drugs, or told about...well, lots of things, in the West. at the very least liberal scholars can't even get their story straight about what happened during the Holodomor. so even if it did happen, and not saying one way or another, there's a lot of misinformation even from tem. *them. yep. like we said, a famine occurred. famines can occur because of drought and natural circumstances beyond human control. i could be wrong, to be honest. but it seems like liberal scholars are to be skeptical of, at the *very* least. i mean, what do you think of Fidel? i mean, heck, Batista supporters/rich Cubans living in the US would have you believe he was a monster who boiled babies for soup stock. (exaggeration, but). can the dust bowl be considered an intentional famine? . 1) the capitalist elite lies about things that happen all the time and uses extreme propaganda to further its aims. 2) knowing this, it is valuable to evaluate causes that the capitalist elite lionizes, and see if what they sell you as fact is in fact fiction. America sold white people the notion that black people are dangerous criminal thugs hooked on drugs. (when in reality, it was advantageous to spread crack to black neighborhoods as a way to then spread this lie). see, i don't want to deny any mass killings. is the thing. but the problem is, it is at least very possible that not everything capitalists tell us is true, and from what I've seen, it's very possible that this incident (the so-called Holodomor) might not have been an intentional genocide. i wouldn't go that far, riddim. and i understand where fluttrshy is coming from. as (mostly) an anarchist, I've often been...reluctant to support ML or MLM because I've been critical of people in positions of power. and haven't wanted to condone any abuses of that power. so i can understand and have felt the...impulse to be very critical of power structures and to believe most any negative criticism of them because power structures suck . even liberal sources admit that kulaks burned their homes and fields and destroyed resources rather than submit to collectivization. which certainly doesn't help any kind of ongoing famine, manmade or no. riddim, i didn't even know about those things and yeah, that's shitty. anarchists are not incapable of being shit or committing atrocities. but yeah, the Soviet Union, along with any socialist state, is by definition not communist. because they're socialist - just want to clear that up. near its end, no, not really. //www.rationalrevolution.net/special/library/tottlefraud.pdf. //www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/Tauger,%20%27The%201932%20Harvest%20and%20the%20Famine%20of%201933,%20SR%2091.pdf. //www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/Tauger,%20Natural%20Disaster%20and%20Human%20Actions.pdf. //gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=32DAA2871728468189A57E0233492A3A. riddim, maybe they're not aware of that sort of thing. I'd be cautious of being overly harsh here. fluttrshy, i apologize if i've been overly harsh in talking about this, i want to present what i think to be true without being harsh. i understand why you would be very critical of the situation and wary of the possibility of mass murder having occurred. riddim i don't think being confrontational is going to get anyone anywhere in this discussion, comrade. well, I'm trying to use facts and reasoning to show that maybe this genuinely wasn't an incident of mass murder? and even liberal scholars seem to come to this conclusion more often than not. or that at the very least there's not a really great consensus . because a very understandable/predictable reaction to "fuck you, you're wrong" is to continue believing the thing . yeah, and that's valid. I. comrades. comrades i think we should stop. riddim, i think the confrontational tone is not helpful/useful in this scenario. irrespective of what fluttrshy has said. riddim stop. crit/self-crit comrade - it's propaganda that's understandably consumed by anyone living in the West. and hard to disavow oneself of . fluttrshy has demonstrated they are not aware of the history of how the propaganda was propagated or where it comes from. well, that wasn't productive of them either. but yeah. i dunno, I want to at least make an effort to convince someone of this point. because it's such a hard thing to get other people to even consider. (. um, we were discussing a point of contention. it's an emotionally-charged issue and i come at it understanding that this is the case. no one wants to condone mass murder or genocide or atrocities, it's understandable. well. consider that so many people are ingrained to believe this as true, riddim. and that anarchists are often very wary of abuse/atrocities committed by state actors. so regardless of the truth or not of an event, I think many anarchists are more likely than not to believe that an atrocity was committed simply because states are corrupt. and i like to remain aware of this. when talking about this matter. well, emotions were high at that point. i've gotten into states where I was unwilling to consider a reasonable or correct point because i was so upset. while the things you mentioned were true, i think it was unrelated to the discussion at hand and served only to feel like a "criticize X before you criticize Y", which i am not certain was the best way of going about it? idk. i don't think that's exactly true of . let's stop for a moment. everyone. is that in response to the discussion that happened early this morning, yar? it's definitely not about inter-group things, riddim. or about 'anarchists vs maoists' or any such thing. i think yar is bringing this up to say something solely about the interpersonal aspect between two individuals, of that exchange. yeah, i don't think it was the best way to approach the situation. i agree. i apologize if i acted in any way hostile throughout that disagreement/discussion. i don't want anyone to feel unsafe just over a disagreement like that. welcome back, yar. i think, though, the discussion itself can make people feel unsafe, which i understand. enough rope to hang myself with? i rebuked riddim for being pretty awfully confrontational. i don't think their conduct was at all proper. i don't think you were spoken to with any respect or dignity and i apologize. all i'm saying is. well, maybe let's not go there. yeah. i hate autism parents >_>. what's this about? the discussion? mmm. i'm not saying don't talk about recreational drug use but definitely make sure trigger warnings are given? just as a general thing. , what's your opinion on recreational drug use talk here. uh... ask yar. no, i don't mean what the rule should/shouldn't be. i am asking for your personal individual opinion on it. nods. i'm autistic and #wrongplanet is full of utter assholes. mostly Aspie supremacists. and people who don't see the value in attempting to be kinder to other people. people who have not bothered to examine their bias. yello. i made tonkatsu and curry for my gf last night. cooking is yum. . hi. hey , did you know i think you're kinda cool. i've seen you hanging around here a lot and thought you should know. nods. that would be nice. i must admit, i'm a bit of a...dog person, and it reflects heavily in my daily life. hope that doesn't bother you. :O. reeeeeeally? i'm glad my wife has a crush on me, all things considered. :3. why would it need to hold a lightsaber. she probably sleeps all day and eats...idk, banthaberries. or drinks blue milk. i see. have you seen Rogue One yet. nods. i understand. Darth Krayr. *Krayt. Darth Caedus. the Yuuzhan Vong. the Ssi-ruuk. the...idk, expanded universe Mangalorian lore. Trioculus. where's the 14-part cinematic universe centered around Thrawn. I'm glad we'll never see the Yuuzhan Vong in film. i think they wouldn't have been a good fit for a new series of films. can i just say that I have a disdain for Cans who think that Canada is socialist. and who position Canada as somehow above the ills of Western civilization. hello. L(. :(. i'm sorry, Roxie. turnips and parsnips are better than potatoes. yes. she's fine. Someone I know suggested that the physiological symptoms of depression are often overstated by doctors as a way of gaslighting patients/not investigating physical pain, etc. we don't even have the energy to try... crazy trans women can't just, you know, be *correct* about recognizing symptoms like chronic fatigue and chronic pain, right??? i swear to god when we actually were pursuing therapy last year for a bit, we were talking about our BPD symptoms with someone. and they were like "do you think these things could be caused by your dissatisfaction with your gender?". or something like that. like shut the fuck up and never speak to Mad people again you shitstain. Cans who insist Canada is socialist annoy the hell out of me. it means the government helps pay for roads! </sarcasm>. what exactly is it that causes people to ridicule feminism rather than analyze viewpoints . or rally around things like "manspreading" as supposedly-invented things for feminists to whine about (while ignoring the idea that men sure as heck take up a lot of space). mmm. also, no matter how many times it's explained to white dudes. they don't ever seem to be able to understand that "privilege" doesn't mean "you automatically have everything better" but "there are certain things you will never experience/have to fear because of who you are. ". i've been dealing with this for years and still can't...wrap my head around it. i know thinking outside your viewpoint is hard/it's hard to see something challenge your worldview but like...why are so many people averse to even trying in good faith? but who are the people saying "men are allowed to feel emotions, to break down, to need help, to be hurt, to reach out, etc". yeah... how do you present like...knowledge of what's happening without people interpreting it that way, though? oh? i guess i can see that. another reason why feminism needs marxism and dialectical materialism >_>. ugh yeah true. well. consider that a lot of "men's rights" types are really. fucking. misogynist. even though they'll SWEAR up and down that they aren't. i don't know if that's what the speaker was actually all about. but. shrugs. what about good old proud white men who just want to talk about issues affecting the white race? the funny thing is, the SJWs are talking aaaaall about how white men are the devil! I think legitimate issues men face under the patriarchy are...in places I frequent, discussed fairly heavily? I've never seen an actual self-identified "men's rights" activist who didn't have a deep undercurrent of misogyny and reactionary sentiment to their views. well, the people who are complaining about feminism not addressing those issues are clearly not frequenting those places. well. sometimes you can't avoid it. I don't care about making nazis angry or hurt. or white nationalists. there are some people you have to legitimately stop caring about the feelings of, because they will do everything in their power to ruin you while you try and appeal to their humanity. this is probably not the case of your run of the mill MRA. yeah. self-defense > all. oh hush. if they can be persuaded, I mean, sure whatever, but. shrugs again. i don't think that's necessary, The_Cat. suppress that mood please. s'okay. i mean, I could point out how you're biased towards your in-group of non-nazis. and how you've demonized the white nationalists. and maybe we should be more sympathetic in dealing with people who just want to be proud of their race. but fuck that, that's just nonsense. and anyone who does that is dangerously close to apologism. which will not be tolerated. I do think "how to speak to people such that they'll see the truth of racial stuff and not be persuaded into overt white supremacist thoughts" is a good consideration. but when they're flying the swastika in your face. you're right. you rip it up and kick them to the curb. sometimes you have to fight. sometimes, you gotta beat the shit outta nazis. help me do what better? It was more just me rambling in frustration rather than a genuine lack of understanding. but i appreciate it. ew voat. the place that was really eager to post porn of young girls. because "Swiss law". and also allow communities like fatpeoplehate because "muh free speech". it's a gross site. dunno why you'd go there. i think it's a wasted effort. i try and spend most of my time supporting and strengthening my community and loved ones and friends. i don't have the energy to invest emotional labour in "converting" someone. i've tried to be *extremely* patient and use a combination of reason and emotion when talking to people. my approaches never seem to succeed no matter what. I criticized the practice of ABA and one person claimed they were being attacked, and then later clarified that they *felt* like we were trying to attack her because she works in ABA. (Applied Behavioural Analysis, which is essentially just "force autistic kids to behave like neurotypicals because we hate autistics"). even though i said "I don't want to have this discussion be personal or involve anything personal about you because I don't want you to feel attacked, I just wanna discuss the matter itself". some people cannot help but feel attacked when a group they belong to is criticized. though I guess it depends on the criticism and the group, really. they're hesitant to admit, largely, that misogyny is a larger problem than "misandry". many of them view society as woman-dominated. these aren't just some dudes who think that feminists don't address issues affecting men under the patriarchy often enough... most MRAs refuse to acknowledge the structural basis of sexism altogether. yar, how do you even do that? I'd be unable to maintain any degree of significant personal connection to an MRA. mmm. so it's more, you extend care to him via your connection with her. ah. yeah. which is a real problem that needs to be address, i think. but that's not...entirely the same as playing nice when it comes to the people who have fallen fully into the hate movement. can you rephrase that. yar, yeah. no. i am good now thank you. i've never encountered any of the "need guidance" sort personally . at least, i don't think. no thanks. i only visit churches for the architectural significance. ...or the Cathedral of St. John the divine, but that's because they're not afraid to have anarchist/communist works/writings on display and they seem to not suck. . mmm. me too thanks. I'm a big fan of "working within the system" in the idea of "infiltrating it to gather information and then using information you gathered to destroy them from the inside out". like dating a nazi officer just to pass info along to the rebellion. or whatnot. I. mmmmmm. mmmmmmmmmmmmm. ah. ? 252 seconds). what's the 0_o for. public static void programming_reference(String userName) { System.out.println("hello" + userName); } . this.programming_reference(void);. oh damn. hattusili_III what lang . i wanna take a crack at rust. but I want to crack Haskell first. Crackskell. ah cool. i wanna contribute to a language someday. i have so much i wanna tackle tbh. i wanna learn OpenGL and SDL so i can mess around with doing graphics 4 fun. well that's the frickin idea . friendo. i'm messing around with linear algebra so I can at least try and make something. don't gonna let no one tell me i can't. gets real prickly. i know what all these things are and i stand by my conviction to make an attempt. worst case i learn something but don't go far. best case i learn something and make something cool. both cases, i tried, i learned, i win. i mean, i want to learn OpenGL in the context of SDL, is the idea. oh cool. i move a little bit slower in terms of pacing and stuff for learning, cranking out code, etc, but i have fun . i think linear algebra is pretty straightforward tbh. it's mostly remembg things for certain contexts and all the little moving parts that I think is the challenge. YES. thank you. crunchwrap supreme please. unironically loves taco bell. doritos locos tacos are good. trash food that I enjoy. put the tacos and burritls and the HECKING CUNCHWRAP into my body. hepp. heppy. ? what's a whoa. what did they do to get banned. exactly, I have no clue. ah. well, that happens. probably in some list of blacklisted users. me toothanks. *too thabks. *t o o t h a n ks. sorry i'm am new years drunk. oh boy. Portland, Oregon probably. i know so many socialist boys from Portland. Portland is apparently the capital of socialist trans men. from what I know of socialists, trans men, and Portland. yeah. i'm not much of a fan of Cascadian eco-nationalism but apparently it's a more or less okay ecosystem for socialist trans folks. are you Maoist OERIAS. ah. Maoism just seems to be a very popular thing up in the pacific northwest. not exactly myself. i am an anarchist who finds value in a lot of maoist principles. such as the mass linee. *line. oh nice. i wish i came from a biological family of leftists. nods. nods. <sarcasm> no i do not want to buy your newspaper </sarcasm>. It's just jokes based on stereotypes of Trots. any variety of leftist is better than a liberal or capitalist, I think. almost any. anarcho-primitivsts can fuck right off. I'm not familiar with them. googles. Wikipedia says they support NAMBLA? ??? wtf. is that real. why tho. but why though. gross. the Sparts of course ignore the power differentials between youth and adults in capitalist society. and the nature of consent . >We advocate the concept of effective consent—which means that as long as all parties involved consent to the act, nobody, least of all the state, has any right to tell them they can’t do it. . this is a very overly simplistic view of consent. eugh. i think people who are that kind of 'sex positive' completely fail to realize. the uh, you know, intricacies of compulsory sexuality in patriarchy. and how society simultaneously stigmatizes but also demands a narrow kind of sexuality . well. "let kids have sex with adults if both parties consent". kind of tihng. like we just said the Sparts advocate for. i personally don't believe simply having sex is a radical act - maybe the way you have it can be counter to the norm, but. being sexual in a specific, toxically masculine way is expected of men in patriarchy and demanded that women submit to in patriarchy. sex, in my opinion, is neither good nor bad. it just is. and people are allowed to like it or enjoy it, but the idea of it having osme intrinsic worth is ridiculous. the idea of sexuality necessarily being somehow core to humanity is ridiculous and needs to be eliminated, imo. I just wanna say HAPPY NEW YEAAAAAAAAARRRRR! (Sorry for sidetrack, the US is late). heppy. i find that people who apply "let people have sex with whomever they want and do whatever they want without question so long as it's consensual" don't like . attempt to criticize or analyze sexuality or consent whatsoever. err, apply that in an absolutist manner. people don't consider the concept of sex being able to harm people, even 'consensual' sex. even in a communist society where capitalism and the patriarchy had been abolished I would say that even then the best thing to do would be to, uh, not have sex with kids as an adult because fo the disparity that would still undoubtedly exist in like. life experience and things like that. bor. bork. //reductress.com/post/how-i-made-life-in-new-york-work-on-a-150000-salary/ Reductress is such a good satire . well, i mean. I read an article about how some rich new yorkers feel "very poor". Like some family that was making $500,000/yr and was saying something like "we get by okay but we're so, so poor". yeah. yeah. for oil in tents and purposes. *porpoises. for auld in tensor purses. is at the hackerspace working on haskell. i would rather kind of had hillary but we must also remain cognizant of the evil of a hillary presidency, too. well, the fact that Hillary's foreign policy would also undoubtedly have involved an increase in drone strikes, imperialism in foreign countries. that Hillary and her policies have in the past lead to increased violence against Black people in this country. that she and Bill very much ramped up incarceration, and we must be aware that prison is a horrific thing in this society. RaeBae69, there's no need to private message me, please don't without asking. in the future. thanks. to answer your question, I'm a communist. . so, a Leftist. very much of an ancom. hah. did that scare them off....? i think they should be banned. dunno if that's overkill or I'm just paranid. paranoid. which rapist is in question? yeah. this is a thing stretching back years. no not really, sorry. byeee. 13? He's almost enough to give up his trump worship and become a modern-day Edelweiss Pirate. *almost old. heck why not start right now. oh geez. haskell is able to handle huge amounts of recursion with ease. ...i can see this becoming one of my favourite languages.
